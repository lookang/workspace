<h1>Balls In A Box </h1>
<p>The Balls in a Box model shows that the phase-space trajectory of a system of 
particles is very sensitive to its initial conditions. In general, an isolated 
system of many particles that is prepared in a nonrandom configuration will 
change in time so as to approach its most random configuration where it is in 
equilibrium. What happens if we choose the initial conditions in a very special 
way? </p>

<p>The default initial condition corresponds to eight stationary particles 
perfectly aligned on the x-axis. Two particles approach from the left and the 
right. What happens when these particles collide with the eight stationary 
particles? The Ejs model solves Newton's second law of motion numerically but 
pauses when a collision is detected. This is called an Ejs event. Conservation 
of energy and momentum are applied at the event and the simulation is resumed. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Perturb one of the stationary particles ever so slightly and observe the 
	resulting trajectories. </li>
  <li>Select other pre-programmed experiments and observe the motion.</li><li>
	Simulations accumulate error due to both the finite precision of computer 
	arithmetic and the approximate nature of finite-difference algorithms.&nbsp; How 
	do these errors manifest themselves in this simulation?</li>
</ul>

      This simulation was created by Wolfgang Christian using the Easy Java 
		Simulations (Ejs) modeling tool.&nbsp; It is based on a Java program 
		from the Statistical and Thermal Physics Project. You can modify this 
		simulation if you have Ejs installed by right-clicking within a plot and 
		selecting &quot;Open Ejs Model&quot; from the pop-up menu item. Information about 
		Ejs is available at: &lt;<b>http://www.um.es/fem/Ejs/</b>&gt;.</p>
