      This simulation uses Easy Java Simulations (Ejs) to model the problem of 
      a rocket car on an incline plane.&nbsp; When the car reaches the bottom of 
		the incline it can be set to bounce (elastic collision) with the stop 
		attached to the bottom of the incline.&nbsp; The total mass of the car 
		is 2.0 kg which consists of the car body (1 kg), two front wheels (0.4 
		kg) and two rear wheels (0.6 kg).&nbsp; The front and rear wheels rotate 
		and are uniform disks.&nbsp; In the simulation you can set the incline angle 
		(in radians), the bounce, the thrust of the car's rocket (in Newtons), 
		and you can drag the car to its initial position.

    </p>
    <p align="justify"><b>1.</b> Calculate the acceleration of the car, subject 
	to an arbitrary thrust, T, by using Newton's second law for linear motion 
	(forces) and rotational motion (torques).&nbsp; Your answer should be 
	given in terms of the mass of the car body <i>m</i><sub>B</sub>, the mass of 
	the front and rear wheels, <i>m</i><sub>F</sub> and <i>m</i><sub>R</sub>, 
	the incline angle &#952;, and the thrust, <i>T</i>.</p>
	<p align="justify"><b>2.</b> In terms of your expression for the 
	acceleration found in Question 1, determine the time it takes the car to 
	reach the bottom of the incline subject to an arbitrary thrust, <i>T</i>.&nbsp; 
	Also determine the period of oscillation for the car.&nbsp; Once you have a 
	general form for the period, check your answer against the simulation.</p>
	<p align="justify"><b>3.</b> Find the thrust that yields zero acceleration 
	of the rocket.</p>
	<p align="justify"><b>4.</b> Calculate the velocity of the car at the bottom 
	of the incline when subject to an arbitrary thrust, <i>T</i>, from its 
	rocket.&nbsp; Your answer should be given in terms of the variables 
	described in Question 1 and the thrust, <i>T</i> and the distance the car 
	moves down the incline, <i>L</i>.&nbsp; Once you have a general form for the 
	velocity, check your answer against the simulation.</p>
