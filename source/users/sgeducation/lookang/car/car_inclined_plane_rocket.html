      This simulation uses Easy Java Simulations (Ejs) to model the problem of 
      a rocket car on an incline plane.&nbsp; When the car reaches the bottom of 
		the incline it can be set to bounce (elastic collision) with the stop 
		attached to the bottom of the incline.&nbsp; The total mass of the car 
		is 2.0 kg which consists of the car body (1 kg), two front wheels (0.4 
		kg) and two rear wheels (0.6 kg).&nbsp; The front and rear wheels rotate 
		and are uniform disks.&nbsp; In the simulation you can set the incline angle 
		(in radians), the bounce, the thrust of the car's rocket (in Newtons), and you can 
		drag the car to its initial position.
