      This simulation uses Easy Java Simulations (Ejs) to model the problem of 
      a rocket car on an incline plane.&nbsp; When the car reaches the bottom of 
		the incline it can be set to bounce (elastic collision) with the stop 
		attached to the bottom of the incline.&nbsp; The total mass of the car 
		is 2.0 kg which consists of the car body (1 kg), two front wheels (0.4 
		kg) and two rear wheels (0.6 kg).&nbsp; The front and rear wheels rotate 
		and are uniform disks.&nbsp; In the simulation you can set the incline angle 
		(in radians), the bounce, the thrust of the car's rocket (in Newtons), 
		and you can drag the car to its initial position.

      <b>Questions</b></p>

    </p>
    <p align="justify"><b>1.</b> Calculate the change in potential energy of the 
	car when it reaches the bottom of the incline.&nbsp; Your answer should be 
	given in terms of the mass of the car body <i>m</i><sub>B</sub>, the mass of 
	the front and rear wheels, <i>m</i><sub>F</sub> and <i>m</i><sub>R</sub>, 
	the incline angle &#952;, and the distance the car moves down the incline, <i>L</i>.</p>
	<p align="justify"><b>2.</b> Calculate the velocity of the car at the bottom 
	of the incline when subject to an arbitrary thrust, <i>T</i>, from its 
	rocket.&nbsp; Don't forget that the wheels of the car rotate.&nbsp; Your 
	answer should be given in terms of the variables described in Question 1 and 
	the thrust, <i>T</i>.&nbsp; Once you have a general form for the velocity, 
	check your answer against the simulation.</p>
	<p align="justify"><b>3.</b> Given the velocity you found in Question 2, 
	determine the acceleration of the car subject to an arbitrary thrust, <i>T</i>.&nbsp; 
	Again your answer should be given in terms of the variables described in 
	Question 1.&nbsp; Once you have a general form for the acceleration, check 
	your answer against the simulation.&nbsp; Also find the thrust that yields 
	zero acceleration of the rocket.</p>
