Momentum One Dimension Collision Model<br>
<br>
The motion of a body of mass m and velocity v is described by a vector
quantity known as momentum p where<br>
<br>
p = m v<br>
<br>
&nbsp;When
objects collide, whether trains, cars, billiard balls, shopping carts,
or your foot and the sidewalk, the results can be complicated. Yet even
in the most chaotic of collisions, as long as there are no net external
forces acting on the colliding objects, one principle always holds and
provides an excellent tool for understanding the collision. That
principle is called the conservation of linear momentum which states
that<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The total momentum of a system remains constant provided that no
external resultant force acts on the system<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For two bodies colliding linearly, it is written mathematically as a
vector equation<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Total initial momentum = total final momentum<br>
<br>
m<sub>1</sub>.u<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>.u<sub>2</sub> = m<sub>1</sub>.v<sub>1</sub>
+ m<sub>2</sub>.v<sub>2</sub><br>
<br>
<br>
If
external forces (such as friction) are ignored, the total momentum of
two carts prior to a collision (left side of equation) is the same as
the total momentum of the carts after the collision (right side of
equation).<br>
<br>
Collisions are classified into elastic (or perfectly elastic),
inelastic and completely inelastic.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There is also a concept of kinetic energy of a moving body is stated
mathematically by the following equation:<br>
<br>
KE1 = &frac12; m<sub>1</sub>.v<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Main Simulation View<br>
The simulation has 2 collision carts on frictionless floor and wheels.<br>
Sliders <br>
<br>
Explore the sliders allows varying the variables .<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * mass of cart ONE, mass_1, m<sub>1</sub> in kg<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * initial velocity of cart ONE, u<sub>1</sub> in m/s<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * mass of cart TWO, mass_2, m<sub>2</sub> in kg<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * initial velocity of cart TWO, u<sub>2</sub> in m/s<br>

Radio Buttons<br>
Allows for selecting what kind of collision is simulated.<br>
<br>
A
Perfectly elastic collision is defined as one in which both
conservation of momentum and conservation of kinetic energy are observed<br>
A
Perfectly Inelastic collision is defined as one in which conservation
of momentum is observed but the colliding carts stick together after
collision with kinetic energy loss<br>
<br>
Checkboxes<br>
show: velocity, for visualizing the velocity vector<br>
plot momentum vs time graph, for different representation of data for
momentum of cart 1, 2 and both.<br>
plot kinetic energy vs time graph, for different representation of data
for kinetic energy of cart 1, 2 and both.<br>
paused when collide, for visualizing the change in the velocity u<sub>1</sub>
and u<sub>2</sub> to v<sub>1</sub> and v2<br>
fast
simulation, for cases where the velocity are low and repeat learners
can spend time more usefully collecting and analysing data.<br>

The Momentum 1D Collision model was created by created by
lookang using the Easy Java Simulations (EJS) version 4.2 authoring and
modeling tool. An applet version of this model is available on the NTNU
website . Shout our thanks
to the Ejs community namely, Francisco Esquembre , Fu-Kwun Hwang and
Wolfgang Christian for their professional learning community support.
You can examine and modify this compiled EJS model if you run the model
(double click on the model's jar file), right-click within a plot, and
select "Open EJS Model" from the pop-up menu. You must, of course, have
EJS installed on your computer. Information about EJS is available at: <a
