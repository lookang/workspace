<h1>Pendulum Modeling Activities</h1>
<p>Install Ejs and then right-click within the program to copy the Free Fall model from 
this package into the Ejs workspace to do the following activities.</p>
<h3>Period</h3>
<p>Set the initial angle to 30 degrees (<font face="Times New Roman">&#960;</font>/6 radians).&nbsp; Is 
the period longer or shorter than what is predicted for simple harmonic motion?&nbsp; What is the percent difference 
between the pendulum period and simple harmonic motion?&nbsp; Repeat for 90 degrees (<font face="Times New Roman">&#960;</font>/2 
radians) and 180 degrees (<font face="Times New Roman">&#960;</font> radians).</p>
<h3>Angular Velocity</h3>
<p>Predict the shape of the angular displacement graph for angles if the bob is placed very near 
the vertical.&nbsp; Run the simulation to test the correctness of your prediction.&nbsp; Predict the shape of 
a <font class="style1">d&#952;/dt plot </font>for this same initial condition. Add an a plot
<font class="style1">d&#952;/dt </font>&nbsp;to the simulation and compare its shape with your prediction.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Note that both &#969;= (g/L)<sup>1/2 </sup>and
<font class="style1">d&#952;/dt </font>&nbsp;have units or radians per second and both are sometimes referred 
to as angular velocity.&nbsp; These quantities are, however, quite different. Omega
&#969; is a constant that determines the rate of change of the phase the simple harmonic 
oscillator analytic solution whereas is d&#952;/dt is the instantaneous rate of change of the displacement angle and 
is not constant </p>
<h3>Phase Space (Advanced)</h3>
<p>A phase space plot shows angular position &#952; vs.
<font class="style1">angular momentum L = I d&#952;/dt as the pendulum evolves.&nbsp; Add this plot to the 
simulation.&nbsp; Explain the shape of the plot for small angles.&nbsp; Explain the shape for large angles.&nbsp; 
What happens if the pendulum is given sufficient angular momentum (angular velocity d&#952;/dt ) so that it passes 
over the top?</font></p>
