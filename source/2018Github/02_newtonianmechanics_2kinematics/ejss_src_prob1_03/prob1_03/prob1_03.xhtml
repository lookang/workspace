	<h2>Problem 1.3: Drag the Monster Truck</h2>
	<p>
		<img src="prob1_03.png" class="centered"/></p>
		
	<p>Use the mouse to drag the rear bumper of the toy monster truck (the red ball).
		The goal of this exercise is to match the position/velocity/acceleration vs. time
		graphs as shown in the animation (position is given in centimeters and time is given in seconds).
		There is some smoothing for the velocity and acceleration matching animations.</p>
	
	<p>Answer the following questions after trying to match the motion: </p>
		<ol>
			<li><p>Which of the graphs was the easiest to match and which one was the hardest to match?</p></li>
			<li><p>Why? Base your answer on physics and mathematics.</p></li>
		</ol>
