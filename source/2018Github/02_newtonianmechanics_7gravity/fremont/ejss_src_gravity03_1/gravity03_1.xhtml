How would the Earth’s gravitational field (over both    near and large distances from Earth) look like?<br />    <br />    <p>1)    Using the simulation later, drag the red test mass to the outer      most series of blue dots and play and simulation. Every time the field      lines are drawn and contact Earth's surface, the simulation will pause.      When that happens, drag the red mass to a new position to draw the field      line and click play to continue to run the simulation. repeat these steps      until all outer most series of blue dots have been drawn with the field      lines. The green vectors represent the field vectors while the red lines      represent the field lines near the Earth’s surface.

Using the    same steps earlier, try to draw the RED field lines for this case.

Using the same steps earlier, try to draw the RED field    lines for this case.
