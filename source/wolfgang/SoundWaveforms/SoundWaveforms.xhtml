    <h1>Sound Waveforms </h1>
    <p>The Sound Waveforms JavaScript Model explores the aural texture of four basic periodic <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveform">waveforms</a>: sine, triangle, square, and
      sawtooth. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sine waveform</a> has a single
      frequency and is the building block of other periodic waves by summing harmonics in a <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series">Fourier Series</a>.   The richness of
      the sound is  called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre">timbre</a> and is
      determined by the amplitude of the harmonics in the Fourier sum.</p>
    <p>Click on the waveform image to hear the difference types of sounds these waveforms produce
      and drag up and down within the image to change the waveform frequency. Drag left and right to
      adjust the volume.  The sine waveform produces the smoothest sound because it consists of a
      single fundamental frequency F<sub>o</sub>. The <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_wave">triangle waveform</a> has a richer and
      higher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre">timbre</a> because the dominant
      frequency F<sub>o</sub> is joined by the odd harmonics 3F<sub>o</sub>,  5F<sub>o</sub>,
        7F<sub>o</sub>,  etc.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave">square
        waveform</a> also has only odd harmonics but it sounds higher than the triangle waveform
      because the amplitude of these harmonics is greater than for a triangle waveform.  In other
      words, the triangle waveform  more closely matches a sine waveform than the square waveform.
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawtooth_wave">sawtooth waveform </a>has the most
      complex timbre because every harmonic is present.</p>
    <p>The Sound Waveforms JavaScript Model uses the HTML 5 Web Audio API.  This API is still under
      development and may not be supported on all platforms.  Try the <i>Reset</i> button to
      reinitialize the simulation if the sound does not play when the image is pressed.</p>

    <p>The Sound Waveforms JavaScript Model was developed by Wolfgang Christian using version 5.2 of
      the Easy Java/JavaScript Simulations (EjsS) authoring and modeling tool. Although EjsS is a
      Java Program, it creates ready-to-run JavaScript simulations and ePubs. Information about EJS
      is available at: &lt;<b><a href="http://www.um.es/fem/Ejs/">
