<h1>Illustration 4.1: Newton's First Law and Reference Frames</h1>
<p>This simulation illustrates basic concepts behind reference frames, and how they
pertain to Newton's First Law. The animation depicts a cart with a ball launcher. In the
first animation, the cart is stationary. In the second and third animations, the cart
is moving in the x-direction. Students will study how these reference frames are
different, and how they are the same.</p>
