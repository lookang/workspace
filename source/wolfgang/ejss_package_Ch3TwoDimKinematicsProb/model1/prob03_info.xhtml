    <p>In PhysletÂ® Physics Two-Dimensional Kinematics Problems we generalize the study of motion in
      one dimension to the motion of objects in two dimensions. In doing so we discuss two of the
      most important forms of two-dimensional motion, projectile motion and circular motion.
      motion.</p>
    <p>The problems in this section are interactive versions of the kind of exercises typically
      assigned for homework and are based on the Two-Dimensional Kinematics Illustrations to test
      your knowledge of these ideas.</p>
    <h2>EjsS Physlets</h2>
    <p>EjsS PhysletsPhyslet&#174; are JavaScript adaptations of PhysletPhyslet&#174; curricular
      material developed using version 5 of the <a href="http://fem.um.es/Ejs/">Easy Java/JavaScript
        Simulations</a> (EjsS) authoring and modeling tool. The illustrations and problems in these
      packages are adapted from the Java applet version of <a
        href="http://www.compadre.org/Physlets/">Physlet Physics</a> by Wolfgang Christian and Mario
      Belloni and are available on the <a href="http://www.compadre.org/osp/">Open Source
        Physics</a> website. The simulations in these package are implemented in JavaScript so that
      they can run on both desktop computers and mobile devices.</p>
    <p>PhysletPhyslet&#174; <strong>Illustrations</strong> are designed to demonstrate physical
      concepts. Students need to interact with the Physlet, but the answers to the questions posed
      in the Illustration are given or are easily determined from interacting with it. Many
      Illustrations provide examples of physics applications. Other Illustrations are designed to
      introduce a particular concept or analytical tool. Typical uses of Illustrations would include
      "reading" assignments prior to class and classroom demonstrations.</p>
    <p>PhysletPhyslet&#174; <b>Problems</b> are interactive versions of the kind of exercises
      typically assigned for homework. They require the students to demonstrate their understanding
      without as much guidance as is given in the Explorations. They vary widely in difficulty, from
      exercises appropriate for high school physics students to exercises appropriate for
      calculus-based university physics students. Some Problems ask conceptual questions, while
      others require detailed calculations. Typical uses for the Problems would be for homework
      assignments, in-class concept questions, and group problem-solving sessions.</p>
    <p>Additional EjsS models can be found by searching for the expression "JS Models" on the <a
        href="http://www.compadre.org/OSP/"> Open Source Physics</a> website.</p>
