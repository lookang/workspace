    <h1>Point Charge Electric Potential</h1>
    <p>The Point Charge Electric Potential model shows the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential">potential</a> from multiple <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_charge">point charges</a>. Use the add charge
      buttons to create additional point charges and drag them to create various configurations.
      The potential at a point is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of
      positive charge from infinity to that point without any acceleration.  Regions where the
      potential is positive are shown in red and regions where the potential is negative are shown
      in blue.  The exact value of the potential <i>U</i> is shown in a yellow message box  when
      click-dragging within the view.  You can observe the point-particle singularity if you drag
      close to a point charge.  A good way to visualize the  potential is to color code positive
      potential.</p>
    <p>The surface on which the electric potential has an equal value everywhere is called an <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipotential">equipotential</a> surface.  It is a shown
      as a white line (contour) in our two-dimensional model.  Equipotential lines (surfaces) with
      different potential values cannot cross although the simulation may show crossing lines if the
      number of grid points <i>n</i> is too small.   </p>
    <h1>Teaching Objectives</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Learning Goal</h3>
        <p>To introduce electric potential from one or more point charges.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><h3>Essential Knowledge</h3> Although only the potential difference between two points can
        be measured, choosing a reference point (usually at infinity) allows us define a potential
        throughout space.  The potential at any point relative to the reference point  depends only
        on the charges and their location.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Credits:</h2>
    <p>The Point Charge Electric Potential model was developed by Wolfgang Christian using the Easy
      Java/JavaScript Simulations (EJS) modeling tool version 5.2. Although EJS is a Java program,
      it can create either Java or JavaScript stand-alone simulations.</p>
    <p>Information about EJS is available at: &lt;<b><a href="http://www.um.es/fem/Ejs/"
