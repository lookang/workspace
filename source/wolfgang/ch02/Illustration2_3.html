	<p style="color:black">When an object's velocity is changing, it is said to be
	accelerating. In this case, the average velocity over a time interval (in general) is
	not equal to the instantaneous velocity at each instant in that time interval. So how
	do we determine the instantaneous velocity?</p>
	
	<p style="color:black">By investing Illustration 2.3, we will find that the 
	instantaneous velocity is equal to the slope of the position versus time graph
	at a specific time. By making the time interval smaller and smaller, the average
	velocity approaches the instantaneous (as we approach an "instant of time").</p>
