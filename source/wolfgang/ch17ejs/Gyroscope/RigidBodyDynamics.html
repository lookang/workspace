    <p style="margin-top: 0">where the angular momentum <strong>L</strong> and torque <strong>N</strong> are vectors. For a constrained body, such as gyroscope, the fixed 
    point is usually taken as the point of support.&nbsp; The angular momentum <strong>L</strong> is expressed in terms of the angular velocity <span class="style1">
    <strong>&#969;</strong></span> and the moment of inertia tensor I as <strong>L</strong>=I<span class="style1"><strong>&#969;</strong></span> where <span class="style1"><strong>&#969;</strong> is a vector.&nbsp; 
    Substituting the angular momentum expression into the rate expression gives the rotational equivalent of Newton's second law.</span></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The difficulty in solving this equation is that the moment of inertia tensor I is not constant in the inertial reference frame (space frame).&nbsp; This computational difficulty is overcome by 
    transforming the rate equation into a non-inertial rotating coordinate system that is aligned with the principal axes of the rotating gyroscope.&nbsp; Although the 
    moment of inertia is constant and diagonal in this reference frame, the transformation introduces an additional term into the rate equation.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img src="torque_body_frame.gif"></p>
    <p>The transformed rate equation is Euler's equation for rigid body motion and is usually written in component form to highlight the importance of the diagonal inertia matrix elements I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>, and I<sub>3</sub>.</p>

    <p>We label the vector components in the rotating system as the 123-axis components in order to avoid confusion with the fixed (spatial) xyz-axis components.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The solution of Euler's equation is not easy because the orientation of the gyroscope must be tracked and because the gravitational torque must be constantly 
    transformed from the space frame to the body frame as the solution advances.&nbsp; Analytical solutions exist only for special conditions.&nbsp; Fortunately, EJS 
    provide the tools needed for an accurate numerical solution.&nbsp; In this model, the gyroscope orientation is expressed using a quaternion as described in the 
    references and the quaternion rate equation is solved using an adaptive ODE solver.&nbsp; This quaternion is used to transform the gravitational force into the 
    gyroscope body frame and to orient the view elements, such as the gyroscope body, after every time step but the algebra needed to perform these transformations is 
    built into the EJS Elements and hidden from the user.</p>
