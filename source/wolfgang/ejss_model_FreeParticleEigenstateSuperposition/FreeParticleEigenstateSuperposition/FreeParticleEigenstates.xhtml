      Free Particle Energy Eigenstates</h1><p>
      A free particle energy eigenstate with a definite momentum p and indeterminate position is a propagating wave.
      It is usually written as a complex exponential function</p><p>
      <img src="propagating_wave.gif"/></p><p>
      where the momentum p is related to the wavenumber k=p/&#295; through deBroglie's hypothesis and the 
      energy eigenvalue is E=p<sup>2</sup>/2m. This simulation models the superposition of N free 
      particle energy eigenstates with weighting coefficients c<sub>n</sub>.</p><p>

      Units</h2>
    <p>
      Although the metric (MKS) system of units has become the standard international system of units, it is not well suited for computation if the quantities 
		being computed are very large or very small. Quantum phenomena occurs on the microscopic scale at very fast times and 
		computations are usually done using an atomic system of units in which the reduced Plank&#39;s constant &#295;, 
      the Bohr radius a<sub>o</sub>, and the mass of the electron m are set equal to 
		unity. The one-dimensional time independent Schrödinger equation in these units is:</p><p>
      <img src="schroedinger_au.gif"/></p><p>
      In atomic units, one unit time is 2.42×10<sup>-17</sup> seconds, one unit of distance is 5.29×10<sup>-11</sup> meters, and one unit of energy is 4.36×10<sup>-18</sup> Joules. This 
      simulation models a free particle with the mass of an electron using atomic units.</p>
    <h2>Phase</h2>
    <p>

    <p>The phase of a complex function is represented using color if the Amp/Phase option is
      selected.  In quantum-mechanical time evolution, the wave function phase evolves clockwise in
      the complex plane in time.</p>

    <p> The free particle eigenstate simulation was developed by Wolfgang Christian using the Easy
      Java/JavaScript Simulations (EjsS) modeling tool. You can examine and modify this simulation
      if you have EjsS version 5.2 or above installed by importing the model's zip archive into
      EjsS. Information about EjsS is available at: &lt;<b><a href="http://www.um.es/fem/Ejs/"
