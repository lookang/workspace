  <h1>Point Charge Electric Field</h1>
  <p>The Point Charge Electric Field model shows the e <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field">electric field</a> from multiple <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_charge">point charges</a>. Use the add charge
      buttons to create additional point charges and drag them to create various configurations.</p>
    <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field">electric field</a> is defined as
      the force per unit charge that would be experienced by a very small <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_charge">test charge</a> at a given location. The
      Point Charge Electric Field model uses Coulomb's Law to compute the force on an ideal test
      charge.  The arrow on the test charge shows the force on the test charge. The field magnitude
      (strength) is shown in a yellow message box near the bottom of the view as the test charge is
      dragged. You can observe the point-particle singularity if you drag the test charge close to a
      point charge.</p>
    <p>Because the electric field changes dramatically in the vicinity of a charged particle, it is
      difficult to visualize its global properties using only a single test charge. A good way to
      visualize the field's geometric structure is to draw a grid of force vectors. Force vectors
      are drawn uniformly and the force per unit charge is shown at each location. The color
      representation (with constant arrow length) uses light blue for weak fields and progresses
      through the spectrum of blue, green, red and black as the magnitude of the field
      increases.</p>
    <h1>Teaching Objectives</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Forces, Energy and Fields</h3>
        <p>Attractive and repulsive interactions at a distance (e.g., gravitational, magnetic,
          electrical and electromagnetic) can be described and explained using a field model. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Learning Goal</h3>
        <p>Students understand that the field model explains how objects exert attractive and
          repulsive forces on each other at a distance: their fields are the agents of the
          interaction. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Essential Knowledge</h3>
        <ol>
          <li> The field of a source (e.g., a particle with charge) depends only on the properties
            of the source and the position of an object relative to the source, not on any
            properties of objects placed in the field (e.g., a test charge). The field of an object
            is always there, even if the object is not interacting with anything else. </li>
          <li> The strength of the electric field at a certain location is given by the electric
            force per unit of charge experienced by a test object placed at that location. If the
            electrical field at a certain position is known, then the electrical force exerted by
            the sources of that field on any object at that position can be calculated by
            multiplying the field strength (E) and the charge of the object. </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <p>The Point Charge Electric Field model was developed by Wolfgang Christian using the
      Easy Java/JavaScript Simulations (EJS) modeling tool version 5.2. Although EJS is a Java
      program, it can create either Java or JavaScript stand-alone simulations.</p>
