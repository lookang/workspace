	<p><i>Note:</i> When running this simulation on a tablet or a smart-phone, set the parameters and
			enable the Sensor, then press the Play button. When running this simulation on a computer, set
			the parameters and disable the Sensor, then press the Play button and drag the slider. </p>
		<h1> Pendulum with Moving Support</h1>
		<p> The Pendulum with Moving Support mobile JavaScript model illustrates the forces and dynamics
			of a pendulum attached to a moving support. This simulation uses <b> the accelerometer on your
				mobile device</b> to read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_acceleration"
				>proper acceleration</a> as measure by the mobile device. The proper acceleration is the
			acceleration relative to a freely falling observer whereas coordinate acceleration is
			dependent on the choice of reference frame acceleration.  Note that the proper acceleration
			for an object at rest relative to Earth is +9.8 m/s^2 in the up direction as seen by a freely
			falling observer.  The mobile device accelerometer measures proper acceleration because it is
			acted on by gravity and  by the device acceleration but it is interesting to note that proper
			acceleration is fundamental in Einstein's general <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity">theory of relativity</a> because
			this theory assumes that gravity is equivalent to acceleration in spacetime.</p>
		<p>You may need to lock the orientation of your screen to maintain a fixed view as you tilt and
			(gently) accelerate your device. For use on computers without an accelerometer or for
			classroom use, the "No sensor" mode simulates back and forth motion. Search for "mobile
			JavaScript model" in the Open Source Physics digital library to find other simulations that
			use mobile device sensors.</p>
		<p>A force body (free body) diagram showing the pendulum rod force (blue), the gravitational force
			(black), and the force of friction (green) can also be shown. Users set the initial angle in
			radians and angular velocity in radians/second and you can adjust the viscous damping
			(friction) coefficient when the simulation is paused. Test your knowledge of pendulum motion
			by answering the following questions and comparing your answers with the simulation results.
			Remember to <b>press the play button</b> after you set the initial values.</p>
	<p>Initial values, such as &#952;<sub>0</sub> and &#969;<sub>0</sub>, can be set when the simulation is
			paused but not when the simulation is running. (Non-editable input fields have a grey
			background.) You may also drag the mass when the simulation is paused. The reset button
			returns the system to its default state while the reset time button returns the system to the
			previous values of &#952;<sub>0</sub> and &#969;<sub>0</sub>.</p>
		<h3> Physics Exercises:</h3>
	<p>This simulation shows a mass m=1 handing from a rod of length L hanging from a moveable support
			point.   The support point's motion is either  the motion of the mobile device or the motion
			of the slider when the "no sensor" option is selected.  There is also a low speed <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics)">viscous drag</a> (friction) force
				<i>F</i><sub>drag</sub>=-<i>Dv</i> that is proportional to the speed <i>v</i> and the
			damping coefficient <i>D</i>.  Setting the non-zero drag is useful to damp out transient
			motion when making observations.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Draw force body diagrams labeling all forces for the pendulum mass at &#952; = {0째,  45째, 90째
				180째} without friction and with &#969;=0.  Note that the angular position is entered using
				radians, not degrees, in the simulation.</li>
			<li>How will your answer to 1 change if &#969; is not zero?</li>
			<li>What is the small angle frequency of oscillation in radians/sec and in cycles/sec?</li>
			<li>Tilt the device back and forth.  Does this motion produce a pendulum oscillation?
				Explain.</li>
			<li>Push and pull your device back and forth.   Does this motion produce a pendulum oscillation?
				Explain. </li>
			<li>How often (what frequency) should you push and pull your device to cause the pendulum to
				swing over the top?  Does it make a difference when you push and when you pull?</li>
			<li>Enter a larger initial angular velocity and observe the motion and free body diagram.
				Describe the push-pull motion needed to stop the pendulum motion. </li>
		</ol>
		<p><i>Note: </i> Because continuously reading the accelerometer may drain the battery on a
			mobile device, you must run the simulation to read the device tilt. The simulation will
			automatically pause after 4 minutes to conserve battery power.</p>
		<h3> Teaching and Learning Objectives:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Write the force law for pendulum motion involving physical properties such as the mass, the
				rod length, and the acceleration due to Earth's gravitational field.</li>
				<li>Solve this equation for small angle oscillations using either sines or cosines.</li>
				<li>Describe the effect of a moving support.  </li>
			<li>Suppose you are holding your mobile device while riding on a merry-go-round.  How can you
				determine the angular velocity of the merry-go-round using measurements from the provided by
				the simulation if you are sitting a distance R from the center of the merry-go-round.</li>
			</ul>

			program, EJS 5 creates stand alone JavaScript programs that run in almost any browser.
