<h1>Illustration 5.2: Uniform Circular Motion: F<sub>c</sub> and a<sub>c</sub></h1>
<p>This model simulates a particle exhibiting uniform circular motion. Students are given
four animation. The first is a simple illustration of the circular motion. The second 
shows how the particle has a constant speed with changing direction. The third shows a 
sample calculation of the acceleration, and how it always points towards the center of the
circle. The final animation illustrates how the velocity vector is always tangent to the
motion while the acceleration vector is always perpendicular.</p>
