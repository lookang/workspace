      <h1>Discussion of the Gini results</h1>
      <p>The results of simulations using the models we have discussed show that for proportional
        distribution of tax revenue, the Gini coefficient is greater than 0.9 for income and sales
        taxes and about 0.65 for a wealth tax. </p>
      <p>If revenue is distributed evenly, the smallest Gini coefficient is 0.42 for the wealth tax,
        0.69 for the income tax, and 0.63 for the sales tax. Again reality is somewhere between
        equal and unequal tax revenue distribution, but closer to the value we obtain for
        proportional distributions for most countries.</p>
