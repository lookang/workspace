      <h1>Gini Coefficient: A measure of inequality</h1>
      <p>By looking at the distribution of wealth among the agents we were able to conclude that
        various forms of taxation and distribution can lead to greater or lesser wealth equality.
        However, it is useful to introduce an explicit measure of wealth inequality so that we can
        reach more quantitative conclusions.</p>
      <p>A common measure of wealth inequality is the <span><em>Gini coefficient</em></span> (or
        Gini index), <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="G">

        </math> corresponds to one person having all the wealth. The Gini coefficient for wealth
        varies from about 0.55 for Japan to 0.85 for Namibia, and is about 0.80 for the United
        States. Denmark, which has a strong welfare program, has a Gini coefficient of 0.81. The
        Gini coefficient for disposable income is typically lower, between 0.3 and 0.5, and is about
        0.45 in the United States and 0.30 in Denmark.</p>
      <p>The meaning of the Gini coefficient can be best understood by looking at Figures 1(a) and
        1(b), which show plots of the percentage of the total wealth of a population owned by a
        given percentage of the population, starting from the poorest person. This percentage is an
        example of a <span><em>cumulative distribution</em></span> and is equal to the percentage of
        the population having wealth less than or equal to a given amount. As this amount is
        increased, the cumulative wealth distribution must also increase. Figure 1(a) corresponds to
        perfect wealth equality and <math display="inline"
          xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="G=0">
          <semantics>
            <mrow>
              <mi>G</mi>
              <mo>=</mo>

            <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G=0</annotation>
          </semantics>
        </math>. For perfect wealth equality the cumulative wealth distribution grows linearly with
        the number of people. If wealth is distributed unequally, as in Figure 1(b), we obtain a
        curve for the cumulative wealth instead of a straight line indicating that some people have
        more wealth than others. If the beginning of the curve is flat, that means many people have
        very little wealth. The end of the curve on the right must reach 100% of the total wealth in
        the economy. A very sharp rise near the right of the curve indicates that a few people have
        most of the wealth. </p>
      <p>The Gini coefficient equals the area between the line of equality and the cumulative wealth
        of the agents divided by the area under the line of equality as shown in Figure 1(b). This
        plot corresponds to a value of G = 0.15 when the tax revenue from a 10% wealth tax is
        distributed equally to all agents. </p>
      <p>Does a 10% wealth tax produce the same Gini coefficient as a 10% sales tax?</p>

For perfect wealth equality the wealth owned by the bottom b% of the population increases linearly with b, corresponding to the line at 45 degrees. For example, the plot (a) shows that the bottom 50% of the population has 50% of the wealth. In (b) we show that the value of G~0.15 if tax revenue from a 10% wealth tax are distributed equally to all agents."
