    <h2>Yard Sale Model Overview </h2>
    <p class="caption"><img src="TwoAgentWalk.jpg" class="centered" /><b>Figure:</b> Wealth as
      function of time in a two-agent yard sale model. Can either agent become wealthy?</p>
    <p style="">Do the rich get richer and the poor get poorer? We investigate this saying using a
      simple easy to build "toy" economy known as the yard sale asset exchange model (YSM) . The YSM
      consists of N buyers and sellers, known as agents, who spend their time buying and selling
      goods at a yard sale. In this economic model, two agents A and B are chosen at random and
      goods are exchanged. If the price of the item is correct, neither agent gains or looses wealth
      but this is uninteresting and unrealistic. In a realistic transaction an agent can either pay
      too much or get a bargain so that one agent becomes slightly richer while the other agent
      becomes poorer. What happens to the wealth of agent w[i] if this process is repeated many
      times and if we assume that the agent receiving the bargain is chosen at random so that
      sometimes agent A gains and sometimes agent A looses in the transaction. In other words,
      neither agent is always shrewd or always gullible so that all agents have an equal chance of
      getting rich. Does this model produce an equitable distribution of wealth? </p>
    <p>To keep our first model as simple, we assume that each agent begins with unit wealth and that
      during an interaction a two agent A and B transaction a fraction &#946; of the smaller wealth
      is exchanged. </p>
    <p>Delta = &#946; min(w[A],w[B]) xx Replace with Math ML equation xx</p>
    <p>Note that agents cannot go into debt is this model because the wealth exchanged is always
      less than the wealth of the poorer agent but that the total wealth of the system remains
      constant because one agent gains wealth while the other agent looses wealth. A single
      evolution step consists of N random transactions so that each agent participates in an average
      of one buyer and one seller transaction during each evolution step.</p>
