        <p>We have learned by simulating several simple models that the result of random exchanges of
          wealth between agents causes the wealth to eventually accumulate in a single agent, leading
          to excessive wealth inequality. We also saw that it is important to have some type of wealth
          distribution to reduce wealth inequality. A progressive tax on wealth plus an equal
          distribution of tax revenue leads to the greatest reduction of wealth inequality among the
          various taxation and tax revenue distribution mechanisms that we considered.</p>
        <p>The big question that is unanswered by the models that we have considered is what policies
          lead to greater economic growth per capita? Recent studies have shown that if the wealth
          inequality in a society is too high, economic growth is also limited. If there are too many
          poor people, who will buy the goods that are produced? So there is much work to be done to
          understand how to best balance the desire for a just society with a rising standard of
          living for everyone.</p></div>
