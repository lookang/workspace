  <body><h1>Faraday's Law</h1><p>The Faraday's Law simulation models how a changing magnetic flux
      creates an electromotive force (an emf), -d&#934;/dt = emf. The magnetic flux &#934; is a
      measure of the amount of magnetic field flowing perpendicularly through an area and the emf is
      the voltage that is observed along the area's perimeter. The flux Φ is given by <strong>B
        &#8226; A</strong> for a uniform magnetic field and constant area. For non-uniform fields,
      we perform an average using a surface integral:</p><img src="Faraday.gif" alt="Faraday Law"
       /><p>In this simulation, the magnetic field is perpendicular to the computer screen and the
      magnitude is given by the function <i>B(x,t)</i>. This field strength is shown using color to
      indicate the field's direction and magnitude. Blue indicates the magnetic field is into the
      page; red indicates it is out of the page. The intensity of the color is proportional to the
      magnitude of the magnetic field. <strong>Position is given in meters, magnetic field strength
        is given in milliTesla, emf is given in millivolts, and the animation time is given in
        seconds. Note that the animation time is faster than real time.</strong>.</p><p><b>Consider
        a constant magnetic field.</b> Set <i>B(x,t) = 1</i> to produce a uniform magnetic field
      with constant magnitude. The Φ output shows the flux passing through the area enclosed by the
      wires. The separation between the two horizontal wires is 6 m. Slide the wire and notice that
      the <i>emf</i> remains zero because the simulation clock is not running. Press the Play button
      to start the clock and drag the wire. Note that an <i>emf</i> is produced as you drag the
      wire. The direction of current in the loop is indicated by the current arrow below the loop. </p><ol>
      <li>Drag the wire to the left, middle, and right side of the circuit and record the values of
        Φ. Do these values agree with <strong>B &#8226; A</strong>?</li>
      <li>What is the direction of the current and the sign of the <i>emf</i> when the you drag the
        wire to the left? To the right?</li>
      <li>Set <i>B(x,t) = -1</i> and repeat question 2.</li>
    </ol><p><b>Consider a changing magnetic field.</b> Set <i>B(x,t) = sin(pi*t/10)</i> to produce a
      uniform magnetic field that varies sinusoidally. The graph shows the induced emf in the wires
      as a function of time. The direction of current in the loop is indicated by the current arrow
      below the loop.</p><p>Notice that, for the first 10 s of the animation, there is a decreasing
      flux through the loop as the magnetic field changes from out to into the screen. Also notice
      that there is an emf induced in the wire loop and an induced current. Is the induced current
      in the loop in the direction you would expect from Faraday's Law? The induced current may be
      in the opposite direction as you expected. Because of the minus sign in Faraday's law (Lenz's
      law), the <i>emf</i> is the negative of the slope of the flux vs. time graph. From t = 0 s to
      t = 5 s the magnetic field is increasing and therefore the emf is negative. Now watch the
      animation for the remaining time and see how the emf changes with time.  How does the emf
      graph change if the slider is moved to the left?  Right?</p><p><b>Consider a non-uniform
        field.</b> Set <i>B(x,t) = sin(pi*x/2)</i> to produce a constant non-uniform magnetic field.
      Drag the wire from the left to the right side of the circuit and note the <i>emf</i> in the
      top window.  Compare the shape of the <i>emf</i> graph from the first animation with the that
      from the second animation. What do you notice? Since the <i>emf</i> is related to the changing
      flux, it does not matter if that changing flux is due to a changing magnetic field or a
      changing area. In fact, a changing magnetic flux can be due to a changing magnetic field, a
      changing area, or both.</p></body>
