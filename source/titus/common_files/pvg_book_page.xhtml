    <b>Exploring Physics with Video Games</b> combines classic arcade games, new app-based games, and physics instruction 
    in one self-contained ePub readable on a computer, tablet, or smartphone. 
    </p>
    <p>The book is for people of all ages who are 
    interested in video games and even more interested in the physics behind videos games - the physics that makes 
    objects move, bounce, shoot, explode, collide, and jump. 
    Classic videos games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)">Asteroids</a>, 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders">Space Invaders</a>, 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Lander_(1979_video_game)">Lunar Lander</a>, 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger">Frogger</a>, 
    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command">Missile Command</a> were all created with basic physics. 
    Many recent games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angry_Birds">Angry Birds</a>, 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird">Flappy Bird</a>, 
    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_the_Rope">Cut the Rope</a> are based 
    on a robust physics engine that performs calculations in the game. 
    In some parts of the games, the physics is realistic. In other parts of the games, the physics is fake. 
    By "fake" we mean that it follows laws of physics from a fictional universe or employs fictional technology 
    in the game's world that is not apparent to the user.

    <p>
     This cutting-edge book uses games to teach physics and uses physics to teach games, 
     making learning physics and gaming more fun than you ever imagined. 
     <i>As the first eBook to combine games and physics, we are exploring a new way to deliver fun, educational eBooks.</i>
