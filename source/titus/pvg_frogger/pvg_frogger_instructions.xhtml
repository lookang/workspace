  <body><h2>Physics Frogger</h2>
    <p style="">
    Move the frog safely to a lily pad. Ideally, you should aim for the yellow one, 
    which is selected randomly at the start of the game. 
    The frog dies if it travels off the screen (to the left or to the right), if it 
    is hit by a vehicle, or if it falls into the water. 
    To get across the water, it must jump onto floating objects, including the 
    turtles and fish.

    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Click or tap to begin. If the frog dies or if it safely reaches the lilypad, then click or 
    tap again to restart the game. Click "Replay" to play the game again with the same 
    initial positions of all the objects.</li>
	<li>On a computer or tablet with a keyboard, use the arrow keys to jump left, right, 
	up, or down. Alternatively, or if no keyboard is present or it affects the page in 
	which the game appears (such as an ePub reader), click above the frog to make it jump 
	up, below it to make it jump down,and to one of its sides (but in roughly the same 
	horizontal row) to make it jump left or right.</li>
    </ul>
