<h1>Magnetic Bar Field Model</h1>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt;" align="justify">The EJS Magnetic Bar Field Model shows the field of a bar magnet. It has a movable compass that reports the field magnitude 
and a grid of magnets that shows the field direction.&nbsp; The intensity check box will vary the color of the magnet grid to indicate weak and strong field locations. </p>
<h2>Exercises:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Run the simulation. Move the
compass around in the magnetic field of the magnet. Move the magnet
around. What is the
relation between the compass and the field vector (small arrows)? &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Test to see how well you can use the compass to determine the location of the magnet:&nbsp; Press the <span
 style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">Hide Field</span>
button and then press the &quot;Set magnet to a random location&quot; button. Use the compass to show the direction of the magnetic field and
then move the marker (same size as the
magnet) to
where you think the magnet is located. Click on <span
 style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">Show Field</span>
to see if
you were correct. &nbsp;If you were, describe your strategy. If you
weren't, explain what went wrong and try again.</li>
  <li>The bar magnet's field is modeled using magnetic dipoles underneath the bar magnet image. &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">If
you
have Ejs installed</span>, examine
the model and determine how many
dipoles are stacked together (and in what configuration) to model the magnet.&nbsp; Why is it reasonable to model a magnet using multiple dipoles?&nbsp; How may dipoles 
  are there in an actual bar magnet?<br>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The&nbsp;Magnetic Bar Field
Model was
created by Wolfgang Christian and Francisco Esquembre and modified by
Anne J Cox
using the Easy Java Simulations (EJS) authoring and modeling
tool. Exercises written by Anne J Cox.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can examine and
modify a
compiled EJS model if you run the
program by double clicking on the model's jar file.&nbsp;
Right-click
within the running program and select "Open EJS Model" from the pop-up
menu to copy the model's XML description into EJS.&nbsp; You must,
of
course, have EJS installed on your computer.</p>
