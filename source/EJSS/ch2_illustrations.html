	<h2 class="auto-style1">EjsS Physlets®</h2>
	<p class="auto-style1">EjsS Physlets® are JavaScript adaptations of Physlet 
	curricular material developed using version 5 of the
	<a href="http://fem.um.es/Ejs/">Easy Java/JavaScript Simulations</a> (EjsS) 
	authoring and modeling tool.&nbsp; The problems in this package are adapted 
	from Chapter 2 of Java applet version of
	<a href="http://www.compadre.org/Physlets/">Physlet Physics</a> by Wolfgang 
	Christian and Mario Belloni available on the
	<a href="http://www.compadre.org/osp/">Open Source Physics</a> website.&nbsp; 
	</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">EjsS Physlets® <strong>Illustrations</strong> in this 
	package are designed to demonstrate physical concepts. Students need to 
	interact with the Physlet, but the answers to the questions posed in the 
	Illustration are given or are easily determined from interacting with it. 
	Many Illustrations provide examples of physics applications. Other 
	Illustrations are designed to introduce a particular concept or analytical 
	tool. Typical uses of Illustrations would include &quot;reading&quot; assignments 
	prior to class and classroom demonstrations.</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">Additional EjsS models can be found by searching for 
	the expression &quot;JS Models&quot; on the <a href="http://www.compadre.org/OSP/">
	Open Source Physics</a> website.</p>

<p>Motion along a straight line, also called one-dimensional motion, can be 
represented in a number of different ways: as a formula, as a graph, as data in a table, 
or as an animation.&nbsp; All four representations are useful for problem 
solving.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>The study of motion in one, two, or three dimensions
is called kinematics.&nbsp; What distinguishes kinematics from the techniques&nbsp;which we will consider later 
is that, at the moment, we do not care <b>why </b>an object is moving the way it
is.&nbsp; We just care <b>that</b> it is moving the way described.&nbsp; Do not think that
this degrades the study of kinematics.&nbsp; The exact opposite is true.&nbsp; Kinematics is powerful precisely because it is independent of the cause of the
motion. We will  learn to speak using the common language for 
describing motion irrespective of the cause.<br></p>
