        <h1>Galton Board</h1>
        <p>A <a target="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galton_board">Galton board
            </a>is a vertical board with <i>N</i> rows of pegs onto which a ball is dropped. Each
            time a ball hits a peg, it has a probability <i>p</i> of bouncing to the left and a
            probability of 1<i>-p</i> of bouncing to the right.The simulation's histogram shows the
            distribution of final x-coordinates as each ball leaves the board and is collected into
            bins.</p>
        <p>The simulation gives rise to the <a target="wikipedia"
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution">binomial distribution</a>
            if the probabilities of left and right bounces are equal. At first there does not seem
            to be any pattern but after many trials the familiar "bell curve" shape begins to
            emerge.</p>
        <h3>Exercises:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>When there are N pegs on the bottom row, the probability of the ball landing at the
                nth peg (where the 0th peg is located to the far left in the diagram and the Nth peg
                is at the far right) is given by the Binomial distribution: <br />
                <div style="margin-left: 40px;">P<sub>N</sub>(n) = (N!/n!(N-n)!)p<sup>n</sup>
                        (1-p)<sup>N-n</sup>. </div>
                <br /> Run the simulation on "high speed" for a while to build the histogram and
                compare the fraction of balls that arrive at a given peg with the probability given
                by the Binomial distribution.</li>
            <li>If you have EJS installed, add an additional custom method
                to display the results of the Binomial distribution on the histogram for comparison.
                Note that for large values of the factorial (greater than 10!), you should use the
                Stirling approximation (or some other way of handling the large values of factorials
                since 25! uses 26 digits: <a

                    >see Computer Science wiki</a>):<br />
                <div style="margin-left: 40px;">lnN! = NlnN - N + ln(2&#960;N)<sup>1/2</sup><br />
                </div> Compare the simulation to the Binomial distribution. </li>
