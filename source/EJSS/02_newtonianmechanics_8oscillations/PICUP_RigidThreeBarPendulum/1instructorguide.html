The case of identical bars can be motivated      because simulation results can be compared to experimental data obtained      using three identical meter sticks with two large binder clips, a pencil      with a round cross section to serve as a rotation axis, and a stopwatch.      By having different groups of students use different overlaps, it is      possible to obtain a data set that spans the range of scaled overlaps from      0 to 1 (provided you have a lot of meter sticks handy) within a class      period.</p>    <p style="margin: 3px 0px 1.25em; border: 0px; padding: 0px; text-indent: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13.6px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">Depending      on instructor preference, a working version of the computational model      required for these exercises could be directly provided to the student; or      the student could be required to modify, or add to, a nearly completed      computational model; or the student could be required to build the model      from scratch; or really anything in between these scenarios. Another      possibility for producing a working model, time permitting, is to build it      together with the students in class. To carry out the exercises the      student must have access to either a plotting program, or use a      programming environment with built-in graphics capabilities. In the      exercises, different configurations of the physical pendulum are suggested      for analysis. Additionally, a quadratic model of drag is included      (Exercise 3 and 4)</p>    <p></p>  </body></html>
