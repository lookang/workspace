<h1>FPU Model </h1>
<p>Let y<sub>i</sub>= y(x<sub>i</sub>,t) represent the displacement of a particle with horizontal position x<sub>i</sub> along a one-dimensional 
crystal lattice. Because it is assumed that the particles do not move in the <i>x</i>-direction, we need only consider forces in the 
vertical direction. The force F<sub>i</sub> on the i-th particle depends on the relative vertical displacement between that particle 
and its nearest neighbors and can be written as </p>
<p align="center"><img src="fpu_force.gif" alt="" width="245" height="96"> . </p>
<p align="left">where k is the Hook&#39;s law constant and the nonlinear quadratic and cubic parameters are &#945; and &#946;, respectively. Because 
the first and last particles in the lattice are fixed, we compute particle accelerations starting with the second particle and continuing 
through the lattice until we reach the next-to-last particle. </p>
<p align="left">One way of understanding a lattice of N coupled oscillators of length L and mass M is to express the displacement 
of the <i>i</i>-th oscillator y<sub>i</sub>(t) at location x<sub>i</sub> as a sum of harmonic functions with angular frequency &#969;<sub>m</sub> 
and phase angle &#981;<sub>m</sub> </p>
<p align="center"><img src="fpu_wavefunction.gif" alt=""> </p>
<p align="left">where the amplitudes {A<sub>m </sub>: m=1 ...N-1} are constant if the nonlinear parameters are zero and slowly varying 
functions of time if these parameters are not too large. The spacial dependence is expressed in terms of the mode (eigen-) functions 
&#934;<sub>m </sub>. The <i>m</i>-th mode &#934;<sub>m </sub>is </p>

<p align="left">The N-1 amplitude coefficients {A<sub>m </sub>: m=1 ...N-1} and phase angles {&#981;<sub>m </sub>: m =1 ...N-1} can be 
chosen to produce an arbitrary initial configuration as shown in the Ejs <i>Coupled Oscillator</i> model. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="fpu_frequency.gif"> </p>
<p align="left">The system stays in a single mode and every particle on the lattice oscillates with constant angular frequency &#969;<sub>m</sub> 
if the lattice is initialized in a single mode and the nonlinear parameters &#945; and &#946; are set equal to zero. The lattice will not stay 
in a single mode if &#945; and &#946; are not zero. The FPU model initializes the system into a single-mode state by setting all but one amplitude 
to zero and the simulation plots the time evolution of the first six modes when the play button is pressed. </p>
