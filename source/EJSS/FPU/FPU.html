<h1>The Fermi-Pasta-Ulam Problem </h1>
<p>The Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) problem is named after the numerical experiments 
first performed by Enrico Fermi, John Pasta, and Stanislaw Ulam in the summer of 
1953 on the Los Alamos MANIAC computer, one of the first electronic computers. 
They wanted to understand how a one-dimensional crystal evolves toward thermal 
equilibrium by simulating a chain of particles coupled by spring-like forces 
that included quadratic and cubic interactions. It was assumed that these 
nonlinear terms would cause the system to &quot;thermalize&quot; by redistributing energy 
from an initial mode into many other modes. In other words, an initial mode of 
vibration would quickly become more or less random. </p>
<p>When Fermi, Pasta, and Ulam did the simulation, they found to their great 
surprise that energy from a single initial mode was shared by only a few other 
modes; the remaining modes were hardly excited. Moreover, after a long time the 
initial state was almost completely recovered. This result, which is known as 
the FPU problem or the FPU paradox, shows that nonlinearity is not sufficient to 
guarantee the equipartition of energy. It turns out that thermal (ergodic) 
behavior is only observed when the magnitude of the nonlinear term is more than 
a certain critical value. </p>
