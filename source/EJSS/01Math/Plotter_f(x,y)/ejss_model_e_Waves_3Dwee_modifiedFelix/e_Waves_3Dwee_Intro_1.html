      This function plotter displays functions of typical 3D waves <i>z = f(x 
      , y)</i> that may contain up to 4 continuously variable parameters <i>a, 
      b, c,</i> <i>p. </i>In the predefined waves <i>p</i> controls the speed 
      of the waves in the <i>xy </i>plane

      At start of the simulation you will first see the projection of a plane 
      wave in space traveling in the<i> x</i> direction, viewed under 
      perspective distortion. It is embedded into an <i>xyz </i>tripod, and is 
      accompanied by the <i>xy-plane</i> <i>z = 0. </i>This plane can be 
      deactivated by its check box.<i> </i>

      By phase modulation of one or more of the variables<i> </i>the periodic 
      waves are animated, so that they appear to be moving in space as a 
      function of time. As you see in the formula field, for example, the 
      periodic function <i>sin(x-t)</i> is creating the movement in the <i>x</i> 
      direction. The program calculates functions in time in steps of <i>&#8710;t = 
      p*0.1</i> milliseconds. Slider<i> p</i> thus controls the speed of 
      animation. <i>p = 0</i> freezes the graph.

      <b>Play </b>starts the animation, with time<i> t</i> starting at <i>0, </i>as 
      indicated in the<i> t </i>number field. With (<i>x - t)</i> rising 
      linearly, the wave progresses in space. Sliders <i>a, b, c</i> define 
      amplitude and orientation. <b>Pause</b> freezes the animation at any 
      spatial position. <b>Reset</b> leads back to the initial conditions.

      Scaling of all three axes has a range of &#8723;1. The <i>xy-</i>plane 
      cuts the <i>z</i>-axis at the center of the <i>z</i>-arrow. The minimum 
      and maximum position of the <i>z</i>-axis is marked by a red and a green 
      point.

      Parameters <i>a,b,c </i>can be varied by sliders while the animation is 
      running. By editing the fomulas you can change the parts that are 
      animated. You can input new formulas to create your own waves. Do not 
      forget to press the <i>ENTER </i>key after a change!

      Touching a wave with the mouse pointer lets its color filling disappear; 
      the wire mesh of calculation will be pronouncedly visible.
