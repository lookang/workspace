    <h3> Learning Experiences </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Examine representations used in oscillations
        <ul>
          <li>Examine how different graphs are used to represent SHM. Draw links
            between the different graphs highlighting the positive and negative
            values and their interpretation. These will help students to
            understand SHM as a function of two variables (space and time) and
            understand the treatment of vector and scalar quantities .</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Investigate factors affecting period of oscillations using experiments
        or a simulation
        <ul>
          <li>Design and carry out <a href="http://www.unco.edu/nhs/physics/faculty/adams/Phys%20221%20lab/SHM.pdf"
              target="_blank">an
              experiment</a>  to build a pendulum or spring-mass system to
            obtain a prescribed period. Present the experimental design,
            explaining the factors that determine the period of the oscillating
            system. This provides an opportunity for students to predict and
            collect data to ascertain the properties of a system and determine
            whether a motion is considered to be SHM. Students are also to
            understand that it is necessary for oscillations to be small for the
            motion to be considered as SHM. Students can also be shown other
            systems that demonstrate <a href="http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/practical-physics/examples-simple-harmonic-motion"

            to associate each position in an SHM with a position on a uniform
            circular motion. This idea can be extended to the phase difference
            between different positions in an SHM. The association of SHM with
            uniform circular motion helps students to visualise many aspects of
            SHM. Students are to make mental links between three related ideas:
            physical position and velocity of the oscillator, angle in the
            associated uniform circular motion and the position of the
            oscillator on a displacement-time graph .</li>

            system) using a <a href="http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/practical-physics/datalogging-shm-mass-spring"
              target="_blank">datalogger</a>

            . Students are to practice observing the motion and interpreting
            graphs before getting into the mathematical details of the
            equations. Compare the relationship between the different variables
            particularly note the values of these valuables at equilibrium
            position and at endpoints. Students should practice converting one
            graph into another.</li>
