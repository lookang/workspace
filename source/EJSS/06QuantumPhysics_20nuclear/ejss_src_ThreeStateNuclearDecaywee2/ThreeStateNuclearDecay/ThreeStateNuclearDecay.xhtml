      A three-state radioactive sample. Radionuclides change from red to green
        to blue as they decay.</p>
    <h1>Three State Nuclear Decay</h1>
    <p>The Three State Nuclear Decay JavaScript Model extends the <a
        href="http://www.compadre.org/OSP/items/detail.cfm?ID=10576">Two State Nuclear Decay</a>
      JavaScript Model to simulate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"
        >radioactive decay</a> of atomic nuclei in which the parent nucleus first decays into an
      intermediate state before decaying into a stable state. Although the decay of both the parent
      and intermediate nucleus (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide"
        >radionuclides</a>) is spontaneous and unpredictable, the probability of decay of each
      radionuclide is constant and is usually known. The model displays a color-coded sample with N1
      parent nuclides, N2 intermediate state nuclides, and N3 stable state nuclides. Before the
      simulation starts, users can set the initial numbers N1 and N2, the decay constants k1 and k2,
      and the time interval between measurements &#916;t. The simulation counts the number of decay
      events &#916;N1 and &#916;N2 within &#916;t and stops when all nuclides are in the stable
      state.</p><p>The plot shows the time evolution of the nuclides as well as the number of decay events in each
      &#916;t time interval to allow users to compare the data generated by the random decay model
      with a differential equation-based model as described on the Theory page. The Radioactivity
      check box switches the view to show the number of decay events ΔN within the Δt interval as
      described on the Theory page. The Particles check box enlarges the nuclide view.</p>
      <h2>Credits:</h2><p>The Three State Nuclear Decay model was developed by Wolfgang Christian
      using version 5.2 of the Easy Java/JavaScript Simulations (EjsS) authoring and modeling tool.
      Although EjsS is a Java program, it creates ready-to-run JavaScript simulations and ePubs.
