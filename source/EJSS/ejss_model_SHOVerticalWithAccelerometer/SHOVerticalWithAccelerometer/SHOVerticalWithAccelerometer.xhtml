	<p><i>Note:</i> When running this simulation on a tablet or smart-phone, set the parameters, then press the
			Play button. When running this simulation on a computer, be sure to check “No sensor,” then
			set the parameters and press the Play button. </p>
		<h1> Mass and Spring Harmonic Oscillator</h1>
		<p> The Vertical Mass and Spring Harmonic Oscillator mobile JavaScript model illustrates the
			forces and dynamics of a simple oscillator. This simulation uses <b> the accelerometer on your
				mobile device</b> to read the direction of the gravitation field <i>g</i>. You may need to
			lock the orientation of your screen to maintain a fixed view as you tilt your device. For use
			on computers without an accelerometer or for classroom use, the "No sensor" mode simulates a
			tilted device in the view.   See also the Horizontal Mass and Spring mobile JavaScript
			model.</p>
		<p>A force body (free body) diagram showing the spring force (blue), the normal force (red), the
			gravitational force (black), and the force of friction (green) is shown. Users can set the
			initial position and velocity and you can adjust the viscous damping (friction) coefficient
			when the simulation is paused. Test your knowledge of oscillator dynamics by answering the
			following questions and comparing your answers with the simulation results. Remember to
				<b>press the play button</b> after you set the initial values.</p>
		<p>Initial values, such as y<sub>0</sub> and v<sub>0</sub>, can be set when the simulation is
			paused but not when the simulation is running. (Non-editable input fields have a grey
			background.) You may also drag the mass when the simulation is paused. The reset button
			returns the system to its default state while the reset time button returns the system to the
			previous values of y<sub>0</sub> and v<sub>0</sub>.</p>
		<h3> Physics Exercises:</h3>
	<p>This simulation displays the cross section of a cylindrical mass m sliding in a hollow tube with
			springs and end caps. When the simulation is tilted, the tube walls exert a normal force that
			supports the mass and the caps limit the motion and cause the mass to bounce at the ends. The
			springs exert a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law">Hooke's Law</a> force
				F<sub>s</sub> = -ky on the cylinder and the there is a low speed <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics)">viscous drag</a> (friction) force
				F<sub>drag</sub>=-bv that is determined by the damping coefficient b input field.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Draw force body diagrams of the oscillator mass without tilt (&#952; = 0°) at y={-3, 0, 3},
				labeling all forces.</li>
			<li>Draw a force body diagram for  the simple harmonic oscillator mass with an arbitrary nonzero
				tilt angle of &#952;, labeling all forces.</li>
			<li>What is the frequency of oscillation in radians/sec and in cycles/sec when &#952; = 0° and
				the damping coefficient = 0.05? How does this value change with an arbitrary nonzero tilt
				angle? </li>
			<li>Find the spring constant k and the mass of the simple harmonic oscillator by tilting and
				making measuring the response of the system.</li>
			<li>Gently shake your mobile device up and down so that the amplitude of oscillation becomes
				large enough for the mass to bounce off the bumpers. What shaking frequency did you use to
				achieve this large amplitude oscillator? How does this frequency compare to the frequency of
				oscillation you obtain in #3?</li>
			<li>What is the phase shift between the position vs. time and the velocity vs. time graphs?
				Give a physical reason for this phase shift.</li>
			<li>What value of the damping coefficient b will cause the mass to reach its equilibrium point in
				the shortest possible time? Verify using the simulation.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><i>Note: </i> Because continuously reading the accelerometer may drain the battery on a
			mobile device, you must run the simulation to read the device tilt. The simulation will
			automatically pause after 4 minutes to conserve battery power.</p>
		<h3> Teaching and Learning Objectives:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Write the force law for simple harmonic motion involving a mass and a spring.</li>
				<li>Solve this equation for a general harmonic expression for the one-dimensional motion
					using either sines or cosines.</li>
				<li>Show that Newton’s Second Law forces a connection between angular velocity of the
					oscillation, and the spring constant and the mass.</li>
				<li>Write the general harmonic function describing periodic motion. Identify angular
					frequency and phase angle.</li>
				<li>Describe and derive the angular frequency for a specific spring/mass combination.</li>
				<li>Describe why the simple harmonic oscillator’s motion diminishes over time.</li>
			</ul>

			Wolfgang Christian using version 5 of the Easy Java Simulations (EJS 5) modeling tool.
			Although EJS is a Java program, EJS 5 creates stand alone JavaScript programs that run in
			almost any browser. Information about EJS is available at: &lt;<b><a
