    <h1>Vibrating Drumhead</h1>
    <p>The Vibrating Drumhead model displays the analytical wave equation solution for a thin <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrations_of_a_circular_drum"> circular
                membrane</a> with a fixed boundary. The spatial part of the analytic solution
            u(r,&#952;) is expressed in polar coordinates using <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel_function">Bessel functions</a> and
            sinusoidal functions. The complete solution is a superposition (sum) of single frequency
            oscillatory solutions. These vibrations are known as modes and are enumerated by
            integers <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> where <i>n</i> is a positive integer that counts the
            number of radial nodes and <i>m</i> counts the number of azimuthal (angular) nodes. This
            simulation uses the cosine solution if <i>m&#8805;</i><i>0</i> and the sine solution if
                <i>m&lt;0</i>.</p>
        
        <p><img src="mode_equ.jpg" /></p><p>The constant
                <i>k</i><sub>n,m</sub> is chosen so that the displacement <i>u</i> is zero at the
            boundary. Drumhead modes are not static but oscillate with a frequency
                &#969;<sub>n,m</sub> that depends on the drumhead tension and mass density and are
            chosen so that the lowest frequency is one for the fundamental mode, <i>n</i>=1 and
                <i>m</i>=0. The mode frequencies are not harmonic (integer multiples of the lowest
            frequency) but solutions with the same <i>n</i> and <i>|m|</i> have the same frequency
            and are said to be degenerate.</p><p>This simulation shows single mode oscillations.
            Although vibrating systems, such as a rectangular plate or a circular drumhead, can
            oscillate in a single mode, the complete solution is often more complex because these
            systems usually oscillate simultaneously in many modes. </p><h2>Visualization</h2><p>The simulation shows either a two-dimensional or a three-dimensional view of a single-mode
            drumhead oscillation. In the two-dimensional view, large amplitude regions (anti-nodes)
            are bright red or blue whereas low amplitude regions (nodes) are dark.</p><p><b>Note:</b> That the algorithm used to visualize the solution may fail
            for very large values of m or n. The view's spatial resolution is limited because the
            drumhead displacement is computed on a finite spatial grid. The two-dimensional view is
            faster and has a finer grid to it usually provides a better visualization for large mode
            numbers.  Increasing the mode integers will increase the vibration frequency and may
            requite a smaller simulation time-step &#916;<i>t</i> to produce a smooth
            visualization.</p><h2>References</h2><ul>
