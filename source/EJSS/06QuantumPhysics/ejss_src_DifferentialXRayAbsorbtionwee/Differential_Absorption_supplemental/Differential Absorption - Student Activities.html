      The probability that an X-Ray photon will interact with the material 
      depens upon the properties of the material as well as the properties of 
      the photon. For diagnostic X-rays, the photon energies lie between a few 
      keV and 150 keV. These X-rays interact with matter primarily through the 
      Photoelectric Effect and Comptonb Scattering.

      This applet simulates the interaction of X-rays 0f a particular energy 
      going through slabs of material. For the purposes of comparison, two 
      slabs are placed side by side, and a simulated X-Ray image is shown. 
      Graphs are provided of the attenuation cofficients at different X-Ray 
      photon energies. The attenuation coefficient is essentially the 
      probability that the X-ray photon will interact with the material 
      (withought taking into account the thickness of the sample of material). 
      Graphs are also provided for the transmission of X-rays at different 
      energies. The transmission graphs go from 0 (no X-Rays at that energy 
      are transmitted) to 1 (all of the X-Rays at that energy are 
      transmitted). The transmission graphs do include the effects of the 
      thickness of the sample.

      Experiment with different material settings. You can change the atomic 
      number and the density of the two slabs separately. You can also change 
      the thickness of the slides, but they will always have the same 
      thickness. You can also control the photon energy<sup>1</sup> and 
      exposure (think of this as setting mAs). Mixtures of materials (such as 
      bone, soft tissue and other materials) use an averaging process to 
      determine an effective atomic number.

      Use the preselected material properties for lung tissue for the left 
      slab of material and soft tissue for the right slab of material. Make 
      sure to set the other parameters to their defaults (Photon Energy = 50 
      keV, thickness = 1.0 cm, exposure = 1.0). The attenuation coefficient 
      curve (in blue) for lung tissue is less than that for soft tissue (in 
      red) at all X-ray photon energies. This means that the photons are more 
      likely to interact with the material if they pass through soft tissue 
      than if they were to pass through lung tissue.

        Which material will the X-Ray photons be more likely to pass through? 
        Do the respective transmission curves show what you expect? Explain.
      </li><li>
        With these two materials, vary the Photon Energy but leave the 
        thickness set to 1 cm and the exposure set to 1. Is there an energy or 
        range of energies that give a "best" contrast between the two sides in 
        the simulated X-Ray film? Is there some feature of the transmission 
        graphs that could explain this "best" contrast?
      </li><li>
        Set the thickness to 10 cm. Can you predict what range of Photon 
        Energy would give better contrast?
      </li><li>
        Reset the thickness to 1 cm, and now select the left side material as 
        bone and the right side material as Barium. Using the transmission 
        graphs, make a prediction for a range of energies which will penetrate 
        each slab.

      1 Remember that real diagnostic X-Ray machines produce photons at a 
      variety of efferent energies. The amount of photons at a particular 
      energy is called the X-Ray spectrum and will depend upon kVp, tube 
      current and the xray target material (usually Tungsten).
