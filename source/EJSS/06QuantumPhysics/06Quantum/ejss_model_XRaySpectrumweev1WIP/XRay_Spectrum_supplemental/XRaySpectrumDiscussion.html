    <title>About The X-Ray Spectrum Model</title>

      There are a variety of factors that affect the spectrum of X-rays 
      produced in a diagnostic imaging unit. This model shows the effect of 
      varying the high voltage (kVp), added filtration and ripple in the high 
      voltage supply to the X-ray tube.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0pt">
      The physical mechanisms by which X-rays are produced are Bremsstrahlung 
      (in which collisions of the cathode electrons convert some of their 
      energy into X-ray photons) and characteristic X-rays (in which the 
      cathode electrons kick an inner shell electron out of an atom, and an 
      X-ray photon is release when one of the atom's outer shell electron 
      transitions to the inner shell). Changing the accelerating voltage of 
      the cathode electrons (i.e. changing kVp) affects both mechanisms of 
      X-ray production. Adding filtration to the X-ray beam reduces its 
      intensity, but does not reduce all energy X-rays equally. Finally, 
      voltage ripple actually causes the accelerating voltage of the cathode 
      rays to vary below the peak voltage (kVp), so that X-ray tube is 
      essentially averaging over a range of high voltages up to the set kVp.

      Questions to explore:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0pt">
      The total X-ray energy is the area under the spectrum curve. What effect 
      does changing kVp have on the total energy of the X-ray beam?
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0pt">
      Characteristic X-rays cannot be created unless the kinetic energy of the 
      cathode electrons can overcome the binding energy of the K shell 
      electrons of the target atoms. Estimate this binding energy (in keV) by 
      noting the accelerating potential at which the characteristic X-rays 
      first appear. Does it make sense that this threshold energy is greater 
      than the energies of the characteristic X-rays? (explain)

      With kVp set at 120 kV, add filtration by setting the following 
      characteristics of the filter material: atomic number (Z) =1, density (&#961; 
      in g/cm<sup>3</sup>) = 1 and thickness (d in cm) to 1.

        What happened to the overall intensity of the beam? (i.e. the area 
        under the curve).
      </li>
      <li>
        Were all energy X-rays equally affected? Which part of the X-ray 
        spectrum was affected the most?
      </li>
      <li>
        What happens to the total intensity of the filtered beam and the 
        spectrum when Z is increased?
      </li>
      <li>
        What happens when the density is increased? Is this the same effect as 
        increasing Z?
      </li>
      <li>
        What happens when the thickness is increased?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Remove the filters by setting all filter parameters to zero, and then 
      increase ripple. The ripple in the high voltage waveform can be seen by 
      selecting the &quot;Ripple Plot&quot; checkbox.

        What happens to the total intensity when ripple is increased?

        Which part(s) of the X-ray spectrum are affected the most?

      <li>
        Does having ripple in the high voltage produce the same type of effect 
        as filtration? (explain)
