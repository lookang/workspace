<h2>Pre-set Demonstrations</h2>
<p>
      You can access the pre-set initial states for the infinite square well 
		(ISW) via the textbox on the lower-left-hand side of the main simulation 
		panel.&nbsp; These show: </p>
		<blockquote>
			<ul>
				<li><b>ISW Two State: </b>Loads an ISW two-state superposition 
			(equal mix of ground state and first-excited state).</li>
				<li><b>ISW Gaussian: </b>Loads an ISW initial Gaussian wave packet 
			with no initial average momentum.</li>
				<li><b>ISW Narrow Gaussian &lt;p&gt;<sub>0</sub> = 0:</b> Loads an ISW 
			initial Gaussian wave packet with no initial average momentum.</li>
				<li><b>ISW Narrow Gaussian &lt;p&gt;<sub>0</sub> = 80
				<font face="Times New Roman">&#960;</font>/<i>a</i>:</b> Loads an ISW 
			initial Gaussian wave packet with an initial average momentum.</li>

<p>1. Given the default infinite square well width of <i>a</i> 
= 1.57 = <font face="Times New Roman">&#960;</font>/2, what are the ground-state and 
first-excited-state energies?&nbsp; Recall that we have scaled the problem such 
that &#295; = <i>m</i> = 1. <br>
<br>
2. Since the time dependence of energy eigenstates is just, e<sup>-i<i>E</i><font size="2">n</font><i>t</i>/&#295;</sup>, 
how long does it take the ground state and the first-excited state to evolve in 
time back to their <i>t</i> = 0 values? In other words, with what period do 
these states oscillate with time? Once you have these values compare them to 
each other.<br>
<br>
3. Now select the <b>ISW Two State</b> and set the <i>dt</i> to the ground state period 
divided by 10.&nbsp; The text field can accept simple mathematical operations 
such as /, *, pi, etc. Single step through the simulation and see if the wave 
function indeed has the same period as you calculated in Question 2.&nbsp; Now 
set the <i>dt</i> to the ground state period divided by 3 and run the 
simulation. Single step through the simulation and describe the the wave 
function at these times. Why does this occur? What odes this result mean for the 
period of expectation values of <i>x</i>, &lt;<i>x</i>&gt;?<br>
<br>
4. Now select one of the ISW Gaussian wave packets (<b>ISW Gaussian</b>, <b>ISW 
Narrow Gaussian &lt;p&gt;0 = 0</b>, <b>ISW Narrow Gaussian &lt;p&gt;0 = 80 &#960;/a</b>) from the drop down menu. 
First look at all three wave packets. Describe the similarities and differences 
between the packets' initial shapes. Choose one packet and set the <i>dt</i> to 
the ground state period divided by 100 and run the simulation. Describe the 
motion of each wave packet. Which packet initially behaves like a particle in a 
classical infinite square well? <br>
<br>
5. Now set the <i>dt </i>to the ground state period divided by 10 and single 
step through the simulation. What do you notice about the wave function at these 
times? Now set <i>dt</i> to the ground state period divided by 4, then 3 and 
single step through the simulation. Again describe what do you notice about the 
wave function at these times.</p>
