<h2>Pre-set Demonstrations </h2>
<p>You can access the pre-set initial states for the harmonic oscillator (SHO) 
		via the textbox on the lower-left-hand side of the main simulation 
		panel.&nbsp; These show: </p>
		<blockquote>
			<ul>
				<li><b>SHO Two State:</b> Loads: Loads a SHO two-state superposition 
			(equal mix of ground state and first-excited state).</li>
				<li><b>SHO Squeezed:</b> Loads: Loads a SHO coherent state with an 
			initial average momentum.</li>
				<li><b>SHO Squeezed Wide:</b> Loads a SHO coherent state with an 
			initial average momentum.</li>
				<li><b>SHO Boosted Coherent:</b> Loads a SHO coherent state with an 
			initial average momentum.</li>
				<li><b>SHO Boosted Squeezed:</b> Loads a SHO squeezed state with an 
			initial average momentum.</li>
				<li><b>SHO Shifted Ground State:</b> Loads the SHO ground state with an 
			initial shift from <i>x</i> = 0.</li>
				<li><b>SHO Shifted Excited State:</b> Loads the SHO 
				first-excited state&nbsp; with an initial shift from <i>x</i> = 
				0.</li>
			</ul>

<h2 align="left">Exercises</h2>
<p style="margin-top:0">1. What are the ground-state and first-excited-state 
energies?&nbsp; Recall that we have scaled the problem such that &#295; = <i>m</i> = 
1 and chosen &#969; to be 4. <br>
<br>
2. Since the time dependence of energy eigenstates is just, e<sup>-i<i>E</i><font size="2">n</font><i>t</i>/&#295;</sup>, 
how long does it take the ground state and the first excited state to evolve in 
time back to their <i>t</i> = 0 values?<br>
<br>
3. Select <b>SHO Two State</b> from the drop down menu.&nbsp; Now set the <i>dt</i> to the ground state period divided by 10. The text 
field can accept simple mathematical operations such as /, *, pi, etc. Single 
step through the simulation and see if the wave function indeed has the same 
period as you calculated in Question 2.<br>
<br>
4. Now select each of the SHO<b> </b>wave packets (<b>SHO Squeezed</b>, <b>SHO 
Squeezed Wide</b>, <b>SHO Boosted Coherent</b>,<b> SHO Boosted Squeezed</b>, <b>SHO 
Shifted Ground State</b>,<b> SHO Shifted Ground State</b>,<b> SHO Shifted 
Excited State</b>) from the drop down menu (you may have to scroll down in 
the drop down menu first before selecting a state). First look 
at all six wave packets.&nbsp; Describe the similarities and differences 
between the packets' initial shapes. Now look at the SHO wave packets' time 
evolution. Describe what happens to each wave packet as it evolves in time. <br>
<br>
5. Are there any special initial wave packets that behave differently than what 
you would have expected?&nbsp;&nbsp; How do they behave?&nbsp; Briefly describe what each of 
the wave packets time evolution looks like.&nbsp; From your analysis, what is 
the difference between a coherent state and a squeezed state?<br>
<br>
6. Are there any special wave packets that behave like a particle in a classical 
harmonic oscillator? <br>
<br>
7. Compare and contrast the ISW wave packets' time evolution to that of the SHO 
wave packets' time evolution.&nbsp; If you were given a wave packet and were not 
told which well the packet was in, what properties of the wave packet's 
evolution would suggest on well or the other?</p>
