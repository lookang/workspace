          mountain thought experiment</a> on a cannon ball fired at right angles        to the Earth’s gravitational field to come to an explanation for orbital        motion and escape velocity. The calculated velocity of the cannon ball        launched at the top of a mountain (with a height that is negligible when        compared to the Earth’s radius) is 7,902 ms<sup>−1</sup>. This is much        greater than the muzzle velocity of modern military cannons, which reach        velocities of about 1,800 ms<sup>−1</sup>. The result is that Newton's        Cannon could work in theory, but there is no existing way to fire a        cannon ball or any projectile at the velocity required to orbit the        Earth.</li>      <li>Explore how data from satellites is used in Singapore, making        reference to the work of the Centre for Remote Imaging, Sensing and        Processing (CRISP) and Changi Meteorological Station.

Introduction </h3>    <p>In the topics of Dynamics, Forces, etc, we have been dealing with weights      of different objects. Weight is a name given to the force acting on the      object due to gravity. In other words, weight is a gravitational force. <br />      Gravitational force is a force that is evident in our everyday lives and      plays a crucial role in many processes on Earth. For instance, the ocean      tides are caused by the gravitational attraction of both the Moon and Sun      on the Earth’s oceans. </p>    <h3>7.0 Real World Physics</h3>    <h2>7.0.1 Tidal changes over one day</h2>    <p><img src="gravity01/2015-11-09_1626.png" alt="On Day 0, approximately twice a month, around new moon when the Sun, Moon, and Earth form a line (a condition known as syzygy), the tidal force due to the sun reinforces that due to the Moon" />    </p>    <p>On Day 0, when the Sun, Moon, and Earth form a line (a condition known as      syzygy), the tidal force due to the Sun reinforces that due to the Moon.      Note the observer experiences high tide.</p>    <img src="gravity01/2015-11-09_1624.png" alt="At t =6 hours later, note it is low tide around the person." />    <p>At t =6 hours later, note the observer experiences low tide.</p>    <img src="gravity01/2015-11-09_1623.png" alt="At t =12 hours later, note it is high tide around the person." />    <p>At t =12 hours later, note the observer experiences high tide.</p>    <img src="gravity01/2015-11-09_1624_001.png" alt="At t =18 hours later, note it is low tide around the person." />    <p>At t =18 hours later, note the observer experiences low tide.</p>    <img src="gravity01/2015-11-09_1625.png" alt="At t =24hours later, note it is low tide around the person." />    <p>At t =24 hours later, note the observer experiences high tide.</p>    <p>So it can be explained why in approximately one day ( t = 0, 6,12,18 and      24 hours), the combined gravitational forces of the Moon and the Sun give      rise to the tidal changes ( high - low - high - low and high      respectively). </p>    <h3>7.0.2 Tidal changes over one month</h3>    At the end of the lunar cycle on the Day 29, 12 hours, around new moon when    the Sun, Moon, and Earth form a line (a condition known as syzygy), the    tidal force due to the Sun reinforces that due to the Moon. So over 29.5    days, which is a complete lunar cycle, the sea level varies as shown with    orange representing the effects of the gravity of Sun, grey representing    effects of the Moon and blue representing the resultant sea level waveform.    So, gravity physics helps provide a way to formulate an explanation for the    formation of tidal changes on Earth.<br />    <img src="gravity01/2015-11-09_1641.png" alt="so after 29.5 days, the complete lunar cycle, the sea level varies as shown with orange represents the effects of the gravity of Sun, grey represents effects of the Moon and blue is the resultant sea level waveform"      title="so after 29.5 days, the complete lunar cycle, the sea level varies as shown with orange represents the effects of the gravity of Sun, grey represents effects of the Moon and blue is the resultant sea level waveform" />    <h3>7.0.3 Other phenomena </h3>    <p>More visibly around us, the falling of objects when released is also      caused by the gravitational pull of the Earth on all objects. In terms of      explaining for planetary motion, the same gravitational force is also      responsible for keeping the Earth in its orbit around the Sun. </p>    <h3>7.0.4 YouTube</h3>    <ol>      <li>How do tides work? <a href="https://youtu.be/5ohDG7RqQ9I" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/5ohDG7RqQ9I</a></li>      <li>Reasons for the Seasons<a href="https://youtu.be/Pgq0LThW7QA" target="_blank">          https://youtu.be/Pgq0LThW7QA</a></li>      <li>What Physics Teachers Get Wrong About Tides! | Space Time | PBS        Digital Studios <a href="https://youtu.be/pwChk4S99i4">https://youtu.be/pwChk4S99i4</a></li>    </ol>    <br />    <h3> 7.0.5 Models: </h3>    You may interact with the simulations using the EJSS below link (require    internet) or just below if you are using the epub3 reader such as <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gitden.epub.reader.app&amp;hl=en"      target="_blank">Gitden
