    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p><br />
      In the topics of Dynamics, Forces, etc, we have been dealing with weights
      of different objects. Weight is a name given to the force acting on the
      object due to gravity. In other words, weight is a gravitational force. <br />
      <br />
      Gravitational force is a force that is evident in our everyday lives and
      plays a crucial role in many processes on Earth. For instance, the ocean
      tides are caused by the gravitational attraction of both the Moon and Sun
      on the Earth’s oceans. </p>
    <h2>Tidal changes over one day</h2>
    <p><img alt="On Day 0, approximately twice a month, around new moon when the Sun, Moon, and Earth form a line (a condition known as syzygy), the tidal force due to the sun reinforces that due to the Moon"

    <p>On Day 0, when the Sun, Moon, and Earth form a line (a condition known as
      syzygy), the tidal force due to the Sun reinforces that due to the Moon.
      Note the observer experiences high tide.</p>
    <img alt="At t =6 hours later, note it is low tide around the person." src="gravity01/2015-05-08_0956.png" />
    <p>At t =6 hours later, note the observer experiences low tide.</p>
    <img alt="At t =12 hours later, note it is high tide around the person." src="gravity01/2015-05-08_0957.png" />
    <p>At t =12 hours later, note the observer experiences high tide.</p>
    <img alt="At t =18 hours later, note it is low tide around the person." src="gravity01/2015-05-08_0957_001.png" />
    <p>At t =18 hours later, note the observer experiences low tide.</p>
    <img alt="At t =24hours later, note it is low tide around the person." src="gravity01/2015-05-08_0957_002.png" />
    <p>At t =24 hours later, note the observer experiences high tide.</p>
    <p>So it can be explained why in approximately one day ( t = 0, 6,12,18 and
      24 hours), the combined gravitational forces of the Moon and the Sun give
      rise to the tidal changes ( high - low - high - low and high
      respectively). </p>
    <h2>Tidal changes over one month</h2>
    <img alt="On Day 0, approximately twice a month, around new moon when the Sun, Moon, and Earth form a line (a condition known as syzygy), the tidal force due to the sun reinforces that due to the Moon"
      src="gravity01/2015-03-05_1515.png" />
    <p>Now, extending the one day tidal changes to explain for a lunar cycle of
      29.5 days, note that on Day 0, when the Sun, Moon, and Earth form a line
      (a condition known as syzygy), the tidal force due to the Sun reinforces
      that due to the Moon.</p>

    On Day 7, hour =9, when the Moon is at first quarter, the Sun and Moon are
    separated by 90° when viewed from the Earth, and the solar tidal force
    partially cancels the Moon's. At these points in the lunar cycle, the tide's
    range is at its minimum; this is called the neap tide, or neaps (a word of
    uncertain origin).<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <img src="gravity01/2015-03-05_1458.png" /><br />
    On Day 14, hour = 18, around full moon when the Sun, Moon, and Earth form a
    line (a condition known as syzygy), the tidal force due to the Sun
    reinforces that due to the Moon.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <img src="gravity01/2015-03-05_1458_001.png" /><br />
    Day 22, hour =3, when the Moon is at third quarter, the Sun and Moon are
    separated by 270° when viewed from the Earth, and the solar tidal force
    partially cancels the Moon's. At these points in the lunar cycle, the tide's
    range is at its minimum; this is called the neap tide.<br />
    <br />
    <img src="gravity01/2015-03-05_1459.png" />
    <p>At the end of the lunar cycle on the Day 29, 12 hours, around new moon
      when the Sun, Moon, and Earth form a line (a condition known as syzygy),
      the tidal force due to the Sun reinforces that due to the Moon. So over
      29.5 days, which is a complete lunar cycle, the sea level varies as shown
      with orange representing the effects of the gravity of Sun, grey
      representing effects of the Moon and blue representing the resultant sea
      level waveform. </p>
    <img title="so after 29.5 days, the complete lunar cycle, the sea level varies as shown with orange represents the effects of the gravity of Sun, grey represents effects of the Moon and blue is the resultant sea level waveform"

    <p>The falling of objects when released is also caused by the gravitational
      pull of the Earth on all objects. In terms of planetary motion,
      gravitational force is responsible for keeping the Earth in its orbit
      around the Sun, which in turns gives rise to four seasons in some
      countries. </p>
