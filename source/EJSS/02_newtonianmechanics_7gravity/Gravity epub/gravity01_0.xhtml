This force occurs whenever masses are      present and the two bodies need not to be in contact with each other. It      is however the weakest of the fundamental forces of nature.<br />      <br />      In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton concluded that this non-contact gravitational      force must be as responsible for the falling of the apple from a tree as      it is the cause for the rotation of the Moon about the Earth. Hence he      published the Newton’s law of gravitation which states that:</p>    <p>“The mutual force of attraction between any two point masses is directly      proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to      the square of the separation between their centres.”</p>    <p><img src="gravity01/2015-03-17_0858formula.png" alt="This means that if there are two point masses M and m and they are separated by distance r, the magnitude of the gravitational force attracting them to each other is F = GM1M2/r^2" />    </p>    <p>This means that if there are two point masses <span style="font-style: italic;">M</span>      and <span style="font-style: italic;">m</span> and they are separated by      distance <span style="font-style: italic;">r</span>, the magnitude of the      gravitational force attracting them to each other is<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">        <mo>|F|=</mo>        <mfrac>          <mrow>            <mi>G</mi>            <msub>              <mi>M</mi>              <mn>1</mn> </msub>            <msub>              <mi>M</mi>              <mn>2</mn> </msub> </mrow>          <msup>            <mi>r</mi>            <mn>2</mn></msup></mfrac></math>   where <span style="font-style: italic;">G</span>,      the constant of universal gravitation, is <math mathvariant="italic" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"        display="inline">        <mn>6</mn>        <mo>.</mo>        <mtext>67x1</mtext>        <msup>          <mn>0</mn>          <mrow>            <mo>-</mo>            <mn>11</mn> </mrow> </msup>        <mfrac>          <mrow>            <mi>N</mi>            <msup>              <mi>m</mi>              <mn>2</mn> </msup> </mrow>          <mrow>            <mi>k</mi>            <msup>              <mi>g</mi>              <mn>2</mn> </msup> </mrow> </mfrac> </math> (will be given in      data &amp; formulae list during tests and examinations). </p>    <p>Note:<br />      1.    <span style="font-style: italic;">r </span>is taken to be the      centre to centre distance (i.e. centre of particle to centre of particle).      Do not take r to be the radius of orbit!<br />      2.    This formula is an example of the inverse square law. </p>    <h3>7.1.1 Inquiry:</h3>      What can you conclude about the two forces in the simulation below?<br />    <br />    Answer: Based on the evidences from the simulation triangulated with real    life examples, the mutual force of attraction between any two point masses    is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely    proportional to the square of the separation between their centres.    <h3> 7.1.2 Model: </h3>    <ol>      <li><a href="http://iwant2study.org/lookangejss/02_newtonianmechanics_7gravity/ejss_model_gravity01_0/gravity01_0_Simulation.xhtml"          target="_blank">Run          Sim</a></li>      <li><a href="http://iwant2study.org/ospsg/index.php/266" target="_blank">http://iwant2study.org/ospsg/index.php/266</a></li>    </ol>    <ol>    </ol>  </body></html>
