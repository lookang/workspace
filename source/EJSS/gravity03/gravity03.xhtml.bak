    <h1>Gravitational Field LO (a)</h1>
    <br />
    Think about it: How can two objects exert attractive force on each other
    when they are not in contact with each other?<br />
    <br />
    Every object sets up a gravitational field around itself due to its mass. 
    When two objects enter each other’s gravitational fields, they will be
    attracted towards each other.  Hence, a gravitational field (an example of
    force field) is a region of space in which any object lies in it experiences
    a gravitational force towards the object that creates the field, due to its
    mass.  (For your information, magnetic fields and electric fields are also
    examples of force fields.)<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Inquiry:</h2>
    Gravitational field is invisible and is represented by imaginary field
    lines. How would the Earth’s gravitational field (both near and over large
    distances from Earth) looks like?<br />
    <br />
    <h3>1)    Draw a few small (shown as blue dots) masses (using pencil) placed
      very near the Earth’s surface below and draw the direction of
      gravitational forces acting on them by Earth.</h3>
    <img src="field/2015-04-07_1408.png" /><br />
    <br />
    •    The gravitational field near Earth’s surface is uniform<br />
    •    The field lines should be drawn parallel to each other and of equal
    spacing. <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>2)     Draw a few small masses (shown as blue dots) (using pencil)
      placed further from the Earth surface below and draw the direction of
      gravitational forces acting on them by Earth.</h3>
    <img src="field/2015-04-07_1408_001.png" /><br />
    •    The gravitational field around Earth is non-uniform.<br />
    •    The field lines should be drawn radially pointing towards the centre of
    Earth. <br />
    <br />
    <h3>3)     Draw a few small masses (shown as blue dots) (using pencil)
      placed further near outer space away from the Earth below and draw the
      direction of gravitational forces acting on them by Earth.</h3>
    <br />
    <img src="field/2015-04-07_1409.png" /><br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>4)     Finally, draw a few small masses (shown as blue dots) (using
      pencil) placed very far in outer space from the Earth below and draw the
      direction of gravitational forces acting on them by Earth.</h3>
    <br />
    <img src="field/2015-04-07_1409_001.png" /><br />
    •    The gravitational field around Earth is non-uniform.<br />
    •    The field lines<span style="font-weight: bold;"> (use the red test mass
      to draw field lines) </span>should be drawn radially pointing towards the
    centre of Earth. <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>What can you infer from the spacing of these gravitational field lines?
      LO (e)</h3>
                                  <br />
                                        <br />
    <ol>
      <li>The closer the field lines, the stronger the gravitational field.<img
          src="Field_lines_mass_24_lines.gif" /></li>
      <li>Near Earth’s surface, the field strength is approximately constant
        (around 9.81 m s<sup>-2</sup>) and hence the gravitational field lines
        are almost equidistant from each other.<img src="Gravity_field_is_arbitrary.gif"
          alt="" /></li>
      <li>Over large distances from Earth, the gravitational field strength
        decreases as it gets further from Earth and hence the gravitational
        field lines space out further from each other.</li>
    </ol>
