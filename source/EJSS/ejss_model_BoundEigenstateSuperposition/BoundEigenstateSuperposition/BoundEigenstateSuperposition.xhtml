    <h1>The Superposition Principle</h1>
    <p> The fundamental building blocks of one-dimensional quantum mechanics are energy
      eigenfunctions &#968;<sub>n</sub>(x) and energy eigenvalues E<sub>n</sub>. For a given
      potential energy function <i>V</i>(<i>x</i>) and boundary conditions, energy eigenfunctions
      can be determined either analytically or numerically. Most of the time in quantum mechanics
      these energy eigenfunctions are determined in position space. Once these energy eigenstates
      are determined, more interesting quantum-mechanical wave functions &#936;(x,t) can be studied
      by applying the superposition principle</p>
    <p>
      <img alt="superposition principle equation" src="superposition_principle.gif" /></p>
    <p> where the expansion coefficients c<sub>n</sub> satisfy &#931;
        <i>c</i><sub>n</sub>|<sup>2</sup> = 1. Depending on how many of the coefficients
        c<sub>n</sub> are non-zero, one may have an energy eigenstate, a two-state superposition, or
      even an initially localized (usually Gaussian shaped) wave packet.</p>
    <p> Any complete orthonormal set of eigenfunctions can be used to construct the wave function
      &#936;(x,t). This simulation uses the superposition principle to construct and display a
      time-dependent wave function using either infinite square well (ISW) or simple harmonic
      oscillator (SHO) eigenfunctions.</p>
    <h2> Units</h2>
    <p> Although the metric (MKS) system of units has become the standard international system of
      units, it is not well suited for computation if the quantities being computed are very large
      or very small. Quantum phenomena occurs on the microscopic scale at very fast times and
      computations are usually done using an atomic system of units in which the reduced Plank&#39;s
      constant &#295;, the Bohr radius a<sub>o</sub>, and the mass of the electron m are set equal
      to unity. The one-dimensional time independent Schrödinger equation in these units is:</p>
    <p>
      <img src="schroedinger_au.gif" /></p>
    <p> In atomic units, one unit time is 2.42×10<sup>-17</sup> seconds, one unit of distance is
        5.29×10<sup>-11</sup> meters, and one unit of energy is 4.36×10<sup>-18</sup> Joules. This
      simulation models a particle with the mass of an electron using these atomic units.</p>

      Chrsitian using the Easy Java/JavaScript Simulations (EjsS) modeling tool.  You can examine
      and modify this simulation if you have EjsS version 5.2 or above installed by importing the
