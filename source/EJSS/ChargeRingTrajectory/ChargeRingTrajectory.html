<h1>Charge Ring Trajectory Model</h1>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt;" align="justify">The EJS Charge Ring
Trajectory Model
shows the trajectory of a test charge through a ring of charges. The
size of the ring and the initial conditions of the test charge can be
changed. Users can examine and edit the model&nbsp;<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">if Ejs is
installed.&nbsp;</span>Information
about EJS is available at:

<h2>Questions:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Run the simulation. You can <span
 style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">click-drag</span>
in the the window to rotate the view and <span
 style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">shift-click</span>
to zoom in and out. &nbsp;The plot shows the x-component of
position (blue) and velocity (red) of the yellow test charge as a
function of time. The convention is that a test charge is positive, but
of small enough size so that its own electric field can be neglected.
Therefore, the simulation only shows the electric field due to the
green charges. Are the green charges positive or negative? Explain.</li>
  <li>Change the radius of the
ring of green charges and observe the motion. Why does the test charge
stay on the x-axis?</li>
  <li>If you Pause the simulation
and move the charge slightly off-axis, what happens? Why?</li>
  <li>Reset the simulation and run
it with the initial parameters (test charge on the x-axis and a ring
radius of 8 cm). Look at the data plot. What is the period of
oscillation?</li>
  <li>Explain why, for larger
values of the ring radius and motion near the ring, the motion is
sinusoidal (it looks like simple harmonic motion). Hint: Start with the
equation of the electric field on axis of a ring of charge and compare
it to the the force for simple harmonic motion. Show that the frequency
of oscillation (of this simple harmonic oscillator) is equal to
&omega;=(qQ/4&pi;&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>mR<sup>3</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>
where q is the charge of the test charge, Q, the magnitude of the total
charge on the
ring and R, the radius of the ring. Therefore, if the total charge on
the ring is one million times the charge of the test charge and the
test
charge has a mass of 1 &mu;g (=10<sup>-9</sup> kg),
what is the magnitude of the green and yellow charges?<br>
  </li>

<p>You
can examine and modify a
compiled EJS model if you run the
program by double clicking on the model's jar file.&nbsp;
Right-click
within the running program and select "Open EJS Model" from the pop-up
menu to copy the model's XML description into EJS.&nbsp; You must,
of
course, have EJS installed on your computer.</p>
