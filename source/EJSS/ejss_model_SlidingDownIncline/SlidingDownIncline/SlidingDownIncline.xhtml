		<h1> Block On An Incline</h1>
		<p> The Block Sliding On An Incline Plane mobile JavaScript model illustrates the forces and
			dynamics of a block sliding on a surface. This simulation uses <b> the accelerometer on
				mobile devices</b> to read the direction of the gravitation field <i>g</i>. You may,
			of course, need to lock the orientation of your screen to maintain a fixed view as you
			rotate your device. For use on computers without an accelerometer or for classroom use,
			the demo mode simulates a gravitational field in the y-direction. </p>
		<p>A free body diagram showing the normal force (red), the gravitational force (black), and the
			force of friction (green) is shown. Users can set the initial position and velocity and
			can adjust both the static and kinetic coefficient of friction when the simulation is
			paused. Test your knowledge of incline plane dynamics by answering the following
			questions and comparing your answers with the simulation results.  Remember to <b>press
				the play button</b> after you set the initial values.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Set x=1, set the tilt to zero, and give the block an initial speed of 3 m/s. How far will the
				block move if the static coefficient of friction &#956;<sub>s</sub>= 0.5? </li>
			<li>Set x=1, set the tilt to +30 degrees, and give the block an initial speed of 3 m/s up the
				incline. How far will the block move if the static coefficient of friction
					&#956;<sub>s</sub> = 0.5? Set the tilt to 030 degrees and repeat down the
				incline?</li>
			<li>Find the maximum tilt angle without the block slipping (v<sub>x</sub>= 0) when
					&#956;<sub>s</sub>= {0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0}.</li>
			<li>The magnitude of the force of friction <i>f</i> when the block is not slipping is
				often given in textbooks as <i>f</i> = &#956;<sub>s</sub><i>N</i> where <i>N</i> is
				the magnitude of the normal force.  But the simulation shows that the magnitude of
				the force of friction changes as the surface tilts.  Explain why the force of
				friction is not constant.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><i>Note: </i> Because continuously reading the accelerometer may drain the battery on a mobile
			device, you must run the simulation to read the gravitational field <i>g</i>. The
			simulation will automatically pause after 4 minutes to conserve battery power.</p>
