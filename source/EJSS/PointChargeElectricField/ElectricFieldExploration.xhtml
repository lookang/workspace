      field.</p>
    <h1>Electric Field Exploration</h1>
    <p>Use the add charge buttons to create and position point charges. You can drag these point
      charges after they are created or you can change their position and charge using the input
      fields.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First, examine the field around a single 1 unit charge. What does the field look like?
        Increase the charge to 2 units. How is that field configuration different? Change to charge
        to -2. What is the difference? Notice that the length of the arrows does not change but that
        the magnitude (strength) of the field is represented using light blue for weak fields and
        progresses through the spectrum of blue, green, red and black as the magnitude of the field
        increases. When the charge is switched from positive to negative, the color of the charge
        changes and the electric field vectors change direction. A positive charges has field
        vectors that point radially outward and a negative charge has field vectors that point
        radially inward.</li>
      <li>Hide the field vectors and drag the test charge toward and away from a charge at the
        origin. How does the field magnitude change if you change the radial distance from 1 to 2?
        Does your relation hold if you start at a different distance and double that distance?</li>
      <li>Reset the simulation and add two positive charges of the same magnitude. Note that if you
        added the charges at the same position, you must drag a charge away to see the one
        underneath. How is the field different with two charges compared with one? Move one of the
        charges closer and further away from the other one. When the charges are sitting on top of
        each other, what does the field look like? When you move them far apart, what does it look
        like? Notice that the fields add together (it is nothing more than vector addition). The
        fact that the electric field at any point is the vector sum of the electric fields due to
        the surrounding charges is a consequence of the principle of force superposition. The force
        on a test charge is due to the sum of the Coulomb forces from the surrounding charges and
        the field vectors points in the direction of the electric field due to all the charges.</li>
      <li>What do you predict the field will look like with two negative charges (of equal
        magnitude)? Try it. What are the similarities and differences between the two positive and
        two negative charge distributions?</li>
      <li>What about a dipole, one positive and one negative charge? How is it the same or different
        from two charges of the same sign? What is the direction of the field at the midpoint
        between the charges? The vector field can again be described in terms of the vector sum of
        the field from the two particles. What happens to the electric field if you place a two
        dipole charges at the same location?</li>
      <li>Try two charges of different magnitude. What does the field look like? Notice that there
        is a point where the electric field is zero directly in between the two charges. If you
        added a third charge at that spot, what do you predict the force on it would be?</li>
      <li>Add three or four charges and look at the field. Pick one point of the electric field and
        explain why it points in the direction it does. How can you tell, simply by looking at the
        field (and not the color on the charges), which ones are positive and which ones are
        negative? How can you tell which ones have more charge?</li>
    </ul>
