	<p><i>Note:</i> When running this simulation on a tablet or smart-phone, select Sensor to read the
			device accelerometer.  Then tilt your device to test it! When running this simulation on a
			computer,  uncheck “Sensor” to simulate the device tilt.  Press the Play button after you set
			parameters and initial conditions to observe the motion of the mass.</p>
		<h1> Four-Spring Accelerometer</h1>
		<p> The Four-Spring Accelerometer mobile JavaScript model is intended to show how a mobile device
			detects acceleration.  The simulation displays the forces and dynamics of a small mass
			connected to four walls by springs and it is designed to use <b> the accelerometer on your
				mobile device</b> to respond to the direction of the gravitation field <i>g</i> and the
			mobile device's xy-acceleration. You may need to lock the orientation of your screen to
			maintain a fixed view as you tilt your device. For use on computers without an accelerometer
			or for classroom use, uncheck Sensor to simulate a tilted device in the view.</p>
		<p>A force body (free body) diagram showing the spring force (blue), the gravitational force
			(black), and the force of friction (green) is shown. Users can set the initial position,
			velocity, and the viscous damping (friction) coefficient using the input fields above the
			buttons. Test your understanding of how the accelerometer works by answering the questions and
			comparing your answers with the simulation results. Remember to <b>press the play button</b>
			after you set the initial values to observe motion.</p>
		<p>Initial values, such as x<sub>0</sub> and vx<sub>0</sub>, should be set when the simulation is
			paused but not when the simulation is running. (Non-editable input fields have a grey
			background.) You may also drag the mass when the simulation is paused. The reset button
			returns the system to its default state while the reset time button returns the system to the
			previous values of x<sub>0</sub> and v<sub>0</sub>.</p>
		<h3>Physics Exercises:</h3>
	<p>The default configuration for this simulation displays a mass m and its velocity. The springs
			exert a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law">Hooke's Law</a> force
				Fx<sub>s</sub> = -kx*x/m and Fy<sub>s</sub> = -ky*y/m on the mass and the there is a low
			speed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics)">viscous drag</a> (friction) force
				Fx<sub>drag</sub>=-D*vx/m and Fy<sub>drag</sub>=-D*vy/m that is determined by the damping
			coefficient D.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Draw a force body diagram of the mass without tilt (&#952; = 0°), labeling all forces.</li>
			<li>Draw a force body diagram for the mass with an arbitrary nonzero tilt angle of &#952;,
				labeling all forces.</li>
			<li>Find the mass of the simple harmonic oscillator by tilting and making measuring the response
				of the system.</li>
			<li>Rock (tilt) your mobile device back and forth so that the amplitude of oscillation becomes
				large enough for the mass to bounce off the walls. What rocking frequency did you use to
				achieve this large amplitude oscillator? How does this frequency compare to the frequency of
				oscillation you obtain in #3?</li>
			<li>Wiggle (push and pull) your device back and forth to produce an oscillation. Would you be
				able to tell the difference between this motion and the motion in #5 if you were a small
				person (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant-Man_(film)">Ant-Man</a>) riding on the
				cylinder? (Note that this question led Albert Einstein to develop the <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity">general theory of relativity</a>
				in 1916.)</li>
			<li>What value of the damping coefficient b will cause the mass to reach its equilibrium point in
				the shortest possible time? Verify using the simulation.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><i>Note: </i> Because continuously reading the accelerometer may drain the battery on a
			mobile device, you must run the simulation to read the device tilt. The simulation will
			automatically pause after 4 minutes to conserve battery power.</p>
		<h3> Teaching and Learning Objectives:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Write the force law for x and y motion.</li>
				<li>Solve these two equations when D=0 using the a general harmonic expression for the
				one-dimensional motion using sines or cosines.</li>
				<li>Describe why the simple harmonic oscillator’s motion diminishes over time D is not
				zero.</li>
			</ul>

			version 5 of the Easy Java Simulations (EJS 5) modeling tool. Although EJS is a Java program,
			EJS 5 creates stand alone JavaScript programs that run in almost any browser. Information
