<h1>Coulomb Force Model</h1>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt;" align="justify">The EJS Coulomb Force model
shows the
force vectors on charges. Users can change charge of an
individual charge and add more charges (maximum: 10). Users
can examine&nbsp;the model&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">if Ejs
is
installed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>Exercises:</h2>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"></span>Run
the simulation.
Move the&nbsp;charges around and observe the force vectors (as well
as
the magnitude of the force). When the charges are the same size, are
the forces equal and opposite? What about when the charges have
different values (the physical size of a charge in the simulation
changes with the charge value as a visual cue). The drop down menu
allows you to select the charge (by color) that you want to change.</li>
  <li>Add a third charge using the <span
 style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">Add
Charge</span>
button. With three charges, how can you arrange the charges so that the
force on the red charge is zero? Sketch this configuration. If you
change the charge of the red one, is the force still zero? Explain.</li>
  <li>What is wrong with the
following statement from a student? <span style="font-style: italic;">"When
there are three charges (q=1
for all), the force on all three charges should be bigger than when
there were only two charges (q=1 on each) because there is now a bigger
total charge and the Coulomb force is proportional to charge."&nbsp;</span></li>
  <li>Add a number of charges. Can
you still set things up so that the force on the red charge is zero?
Explain.</li>

<p>You can examine and modify a
compiled EJS model if you run the
program by double clicking on the model's jar file.&nbsp;
Right-click
within the running program and select "Open EJS Model" from the pop-up
menu to copy the model's XML description into EJS.&nbsp; You must,
of
course, have EJS installed on your computer.&nbsp;</p>
