    <h1>
      Three State Decay Theory</h1>
    <p>If the number of nuclides is large, the upper state N1, intermediate state N2, and final state N3 populations obey the following coupled ordinary differential equations 
    (ODEs)</p>
    <p><img src="three_state_ode.gif"/></p>
    <p>where k1 is the upper state decay rate and k2 is the intermediate state decay rate. The
      nature of the decay is governed by these decay constants. The Three State Nuclear Decay Model
      displays both the continuous ODE solution for these nuclide populations as well as a
      stochastic (probabilistic) solution that assumes integer nuclide populations and uses
      probability to determine if a radionuclide survives for a time &#916;t without decaying. </p>
    <h2>Discrete decay model</h2>
    <p>The differential equation model produces continuous decay curves but hides the random and
      discrete nature of the underlying processes. A stochastic model that &quot;rolls the
      dice&quot; to determine if a radionuclide decays shows that the continuous model is only an
      approximation. The simulation computes the probably of decay between states 1-&gt;2, 2-&gt;3,
      and 1-&gt;3 during the finite time interval &#916;t. When the simulation is run, these
      probabilities are applied to each radioactive nucleus to determine if it decays. Note that
      there is a finite probability that a nuclide decays directly from state 1 to the stable state
      3 within the time interval . Nature does not, however, skip state 2. We merely waited too long
      and the nuclide finished its decay before it was observed in state 2. </p>
