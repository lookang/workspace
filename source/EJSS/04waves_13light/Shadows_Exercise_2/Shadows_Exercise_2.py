# A linear array of N point sources located a specified distance from
# a rectangular aperture that is centered on the origin.
# A screen is located a specified distance from 
# the aperture.
#
# This file will generate a filled contour plot of 
# the irradiance of light reaching the screen 
# versus lateral coordinates (x,y)
