      <font size="5">This simulation demonstrates &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion-limited_aggregation">diffusion 
      limited aggregation</a>&quot; (DLA). It begins with a single seed particle, 
      and one-by-one additional particles stick (or &quot;aggregate&quot;) to form a 
      cluster. The cluster formed by this process is an example of a &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal">fractal</a>&quot;. 
      As the cluster grows in size, the number of particles in the cluster is 
      not proportional to the radius of the cluster--as would be the case for 
      a one-dimensional structure; and the number of particles is also not 
      proportional to the radius squared--as would be the case for a 
      two-dimensional structure. Instead, the number of particles is 
      proportional to the radius raised to a non-integer power, referred to as 
      the &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_dimension">fractal 
      dimension</a>&quot;.</font>
