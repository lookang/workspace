        <font size="5">Modify the EJS program in order to calculate and plot 
        the number of particles in the cluster versus the radius of the 
        cluster. From this plot, determine the fractal dimension of the DLA&#160; 
        structure that is formed. Try using both (a) the maximum radius of the 
        structure and (b) the mean radius. Does this choice affect the 
        results? Repeat this with several clusters to test the reproducibility 
        of your result. </font>
      </li>
      <li>
        <font size="5">Extend this DLA&#160; simulatlion to three dimensions. (In 
        the View, you will need to use a DrawingFrame3D obect.) How does the 
        fractal dimension of the three-dimensional structures compare to that 
        of the two-dimensional structures? </font>
      </li>
      <li>
        <font size="5">As it is written, the program should be able to create 
        clusters of &gt;10,000 particles fairly quickly. However, as the number 
        of particles becomes large, the simulation will eventually become very 
        slow. This is because every step of the random walk involves a 
        collision-detection calculation for every particle in the cluster. 
        Hence, this is an O(n) calculation. (See <a href="Â http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">this 
        link</a>.) In one dimension, a &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree" size="5">binary 
        search tree</a>&quot; can be used to store an ordered list of numbers that 
        can be searched very efficiently. The two-dimensional analog of a 
        binary search tree is called a &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree" size="5">quadtree</a>&quot;. 
        To improve the efficiency of the DLA&#160; simulation, implement a 
        quad-tree. This will greatly reduce the number of collision-detection 
        calculations that are required for large clusters (although it will 
        take some programming!). </font>

      <li>
        <font size="5">Improve the efficiency of your three-dimensional DLA&#160; 
        simulation by implementing an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree" size="5">octtree</a>, 
        which is the three-dimensional analog of a binary search tree.</font>
