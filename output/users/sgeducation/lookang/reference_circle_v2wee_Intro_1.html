      The Connection between Circular Motion and Simple Harmonic Motion
    </h1>
    In this simulation, you can examine the connection between uniform 
    circular motion and simple harmonic motion. This connection is one way to 
    justify the basic equation of motion for an object experiencing simple 
    harmonic motion. <i>x</i> = <i>A</i> cos (<i>&#969;t</i>) This equation 
    also corresponds to one dimension of uniform circular motion. In this 
    simulation, we even go beyond the equation above a little, and explore the 
    phase angle, &#966;. In that case, the equation of motion becomes <i>x</i> 
    = <i>A</i> cos (<i>&#969;t + </i>&#966;) There are analogous equations for the 
    velocity and the acceleration as a function of time. For more info: <a href="http://weelookang.blogspot.sg/2012/07/ejs-open-source-phase-difference-java.html" cr="true">http://weelookang.blogspot.sg/2012/07/ejs-open-source-phase-difference-java.html</a>
