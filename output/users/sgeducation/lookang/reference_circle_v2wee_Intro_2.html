        When the simulation begins, the two blocks have the same parameters, 
        so they move together. Just focus on the connection between the 
        uniform circular motion (the motion of the ball in a circular path at 
        constant speed) and the simple harmonic motion. Describe the 
        relationship between these two motions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now, give the two blocks different amplitudes, while keeping 
        everything else the same. How do the motions of the two blocks on 
        springs compare? Can you make sense of this by comparing the harmonic 
        motion to the corresponding circular motion?
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the amplitudes to the same values, but now change either the mass 
        or the spring constant of one of the blocks so that the blocks have 
        different angular frequencies. How do the motions of the two blocks on 
        springs compare? Can you make sense of this by comparing the harmonic 
        motions to the corresponding circular motions?
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the amplitudes, masses, and spring constants of the two blocks so 
        that they match, and now just change the phase of one block with 
        respect to the other. How do the motions of the two blocks on springs 
        compare? Can you make sense of this by comparing the harmonic motions 
        to the corresponding circular motions?

        What does it mean for two objects to be 180 degrees out of phase?
